I’m so happy to see you hit this huge milestone ♡ not to make this too sappy but, I can’t thank you enough for everything that you do. I’m currently going through probably the roughest period of my life. last year I lost all my friends, dropped out of college and have been very depressed since. everyday has felt so numb for me. but since you joined Hololive I have had something to look forward to everyday and my I feel like I now have a reason to wake up every morning. watching your streams makes me so so happy, you make me smile so much. I really don’t know what this past year would have been like without you, so I am extremely grateful. thank you Kiara. I hope you can continue to grow and have fun being in Hololive. I will always be here to support you",

We're all happy to you see reached so far and achieved so much and we're excited to see what unveils in the future, it's been an amazing journey to be with you. You wanted to make us proud time and time again, but I think you already made us proud with how much you've given us, you're a blessing to many of us who can relax and relate through you. You're truly a bright vibrant sun in our own dark lonely world. Just remember there's a lot of us who are here for you, 10chou. 10chou was just a nickname that came from your voice acting from Sakuna but overtime it means a lot to me. I'll tell you what it means in a SC I plan to give in some time in the future. I know you told us that isn't necessary to support you but I want to do it out of my own will, I just love you too much. kove ya and take care.",
