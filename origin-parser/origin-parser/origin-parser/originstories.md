# PUDDING

To be perfectly honest, upon first falling into the rabbit hole, it was difficult to find a decent community to any significant extent. Chats in streams were usually stale jokes/strange requests/people being unreasonable.

Comments under clips and on Reddit/Twitter were better, but it wasn't a community per se (at least not in the sense that I was looking for). We all had a common reason, the Vtubers, but something was lacking. The only place with a modicum of solace was with Haachama since I enjoy cursed content.

Until HoloEN came along.

When the girls first debuted, I didn't pay TOO much attention to them. I was under the false and ignorant idea that Hololive should be predominantly Japanese, but also held the belief that the English branch would do decently in and of itself due to the interest from the rest of the world.

Clips were watched, memes were seen and upvoted, fanart was liked and downloaded, but nothing significant.

Then I stumbled onto Takamori. First impressions? "Damn, they've only just started and there is a ship already? Sounds fun, let's have a look!"

The bounciness of Kiara (both her personality and her PERSONALITY) was interesting to me, more so than the other girls. I went on to watch a few archives, streams and clips, and fell into the KFP hole even more, but bear in mind I hadn't discovered the discord yet.

Despite the bottom left memes, which was frankly one of the main reasons I started with Kiara, I found that she was more than mere lewdness and birdbrain moments.

I should have seen that coming with the others like Senchou in mind, but I didn't for some strange reason at that point in time.

I sat there, falling deeper into this hole, wondering, "Why in the name of fuck is this chicken not as popular as the others?"

I did not expect or demand her to rise head and shoulders above the rest, but I was hoping that she would at least be keeping pace (which Kiara did with no issue). Her lack of self-esteem (in the very beginning) and constant impostor syndrome was very relatable, but it still hurt a little bit to see someone beat themselves up like that, when there was no reason to do so.

When her membership opened up, I bought it on that first day. As I continued watching more and more streams, I also noticed something else. Something about the community that was behind her.

I recognised some names. Now, that in and of itself may not seem like much, but consider this. The names that were recognised were not clippers, not verified Youtubers that also happened to be interested in Kiara.

No, none of that.

These were just regular fans, people who loved her, people who supported her, people who enjoyed her content and just wanted to show their support in their own little way. On top of that, I also noticed that the fans themselves interacted with each other and actually seemed to know each other beyond just saying hi in the chat.

I thought they were all from the main Hololive server, so I joined that. Was it fine? I guess so, but there was still something lacking.

Then I found KFPcord. Initially I didn't put too much bother into it, thinking it was merely a "Takanashi Kiara" fan club. But then I started backreading some of the stuff that was said and I don't recall actually finding anything that was toxic/negative/angry, which was in and of itself a rarity in this day and age on the Internet.

And that was when it hit me. Kiara didn't need explosive growth like Gura. What she needed was a solid, stable core of fans that would always be there, pure and simple. Growth is important too, but if there isn't a solid foundation, then the massive structure that is built on those shaky stones will merely come crashing down of its own accord sooner rather than later.

Kiara has come a hell of a long way since it all first started, and I would say that we love her even more than before. She also motivated me to take up clipping, so I have another thing to thank her for. Viva La Kiara!

# CAMI

I started the rabbithole basically with the EN gen. I had seen some clips of the girls and watched Korone stream before, but when the EN debuted I tried giving them a chance, and started watching them all starting with Ame. Incidentally at this point, I saw the least amount of Kiara because as she has said, her timezone was the least convenient. But I tried anyway and enjoyed it, especially the fire emblems and the talking ones, not to mention the Karaoke. I'm pretty sure at that point the amount of videos I watched of her started increasing, and I also found out about the discord here and found people who really cared about her so I started focusing specifically on her. Nowadays I can listen to her for hours and I still need more; I definitely like her bright personality, her moments both seiso and "bottom left", her passion on her work, how much she cares about things going okay, how much she loves calli and the other girls and how much she appreciates KFP. Basically as I said before she's like a warm little sun of endless energy and love and I want every minute of it.


# NEXAT

Y'all really gonna make me type. I'm really grateful for Kiara, my first impression of her was in her first Mario 64 stream thinking of "Hey, I really like her, she’s super energetic and cheerful, like a ray of sunshine". After the stream was over, it hit me that, "Damn, I’m sure a lot of people are going to miss this huh, so why not compile the great moments of her and just put them up" and that's when I decided to do her stream highlights. At the beginning it was just for fun and I guess to get her attention (because getting noticed by the person you follow is cool y’know). But when the minecraft stream arrived (the one with the tech issues), I've never felt such a heartbroken emotion like it before. I didn't want to see her sad or upset about what was happening because I know she works a lot and she gives her best each day and in every stream. So I guess that was my push to keep on supporting her with everything I have, so I decided to take the highlight work more seriously and help her shine through. The fact that she has grown this much, and how her personality and actions have been developing throughout the time just makes me proud y’know. She is more cheerful, and knows how to handle things and is more used to this stuff. I still wish I could SC more and support her financially, but I'm glad I can do my part with these clips

I never thought I would be keeping up with someone just to do my best to support them in any way I can, and I'm glad she motivated me to take back editing which has been such a huge part of my life that I thought I lost...

So, I'm grateful to Kiara for literally, everything.


# HOKAN

This can be little chaotic as long writings never was my forte

At first I started watching Kiara mainly because of her design (I'm a sucker for phoenixes) and the somewhat EU friendly stream times. I was only watching her in the background when I was doing my own stuff. During that time I would feel guilty leaving during superchat readings.

Until one time when I was too distracted to leave the stream and stayed during the SC reading. I was drawn in by her talk and all of the tangents. That was the day that I decided to actively watch Kiara. As shy of an introvert as I am, At the time I was only lurking in little fear of writing anything. As the time passed, I started to notice changes inside me. After noticing all those fan arts she likes and retweets I kinda grow more appreciation for different styles of art. It also made me want to improve myself as a person and made me want to learn to draw and japanese. Before I noticed I wanted to be an active part of this community. At first I slowly started by simply reacting in live chat to the situation on stream. Later it evolved into me joining the Discord and meeting all you lovely mothercluckers <3. Lately it has evolved into me being active on twitter under Kiara and your tweet

During the early days of her streaming (like right before I joined) during all those technical issues she had, she made me want to support her with my everything, but I wasn’t quite sure how. She took my SC virginity and was the first I became a member with. The way that she interacts with fans and made me want to support even more. At first I pitied her for low sub count but later I realized that it was a blessing in disguise as it solidified her fanbase. I'm really glad to stay with her and see that orange ball of energy that radiates our everyday lives soar high.

I love Kiara for her never-ending energy and for changing myself as a person.


# YAGARU

At first, I wasn't into hololive at all despite being vaguely aware of them due to the collab with AzurLane. Prior to the holoEN debut, I had just started seeing some hololive stuff show up on reddit. The Fubuki coverage of the baba oversleeping event was notable to me for how smart FBK was. However, It was a coincidence that I caught the holoEN debuts at all. I didn't watch Kiara initially during her debut. It was only after Calli strongly recommended her that I finally got around to it but she sold me on herself pretty much immediately with her confidence in languages. I thought she was basically the ideal person to bridge the EN and JP communities and I was very excited. However, it wasn't until the 4.5hr SC stream that I knew I absolutely wanted to support her no matter what and I had to join the KFP. After I discovered that German was her first language, my respect increased even more.


All of the scuffed streams at the start and her persistence throughout them really won me over. As someone who never wants kids, she still managed to awaken what I imagine is a paternal instinct. I don't want to call it pity because it's not like I wanted it to just magically all be better. I was rooting her on and seeing her mess up or self-sabotage sometimes really hurt. But I understand that I can't DO that much for her. But this is where KFP comes in. All of us want to see her happy and succeed and having the community helped me to sort out my feelings and how best to deal with the relationship between her as a streamer and us as the fans. I really do appreciate the conversations and ideas that are thrown around on Discord because even though I don't particularly care about having company, I haven't been this hyped in a long time about anything and it's nice to see others who feel the same way.

Kiara's desire to make others happy really made me reconsider how I should act and being able to see that effect on others in KFP really convinced me to give it a shot. I decided that I would just go 100% in on support (I will still point out things I don't like) whether or not I think she sees it or not because it's for her, and not for me. The level of excitement that you see from me in tweets or in Discord is starting to bleed out in real life where that is ABSOLUTELY not the case. The madwoman has me talking to myself at home, now. That said, the balance for supporting financially is something I still wonder about because it's kind of addictive, but I feel uncomfortable even though I can afford it. I spread the love around with YuYuAlpha because I know they're also an important part of Kiara's support.

And get off my lawn, you darn kids!


# XENOL

Honestly the reason I got into Kiara in the first place isn't as profound as most of you here. I started with HoloEN and watched all their debuts with a lot of cringe at first. Call me superficial but the initial reason I instantly developed a fondness for her is because I always liked fire Pokemon and she reminded me of them. The more I watch the more the reasons start to increase, her stream timings are convenient, I always root for the underdog and the tech issues she had in the beginning broke my heart to see her so sad, so I wanted to support her and root for her. As more time went by, I've decided "This is the one" and joined this fan discord, only to realize there is a really warm and wholesome community over here where we can be true to ourselves and support her.



# TUM

It all begin a year ago when I saw the AI channel, but her content wasn’t really interesting enough for me to watch. At that point, it was just on and off about vtubers, until one of my friends in a private server started sending Coco’s Asacoco videos. I started to get interested in this, i was like damn, Vtubers speak profanity english, let's fucking go. That's where my DD road began, trying to search high and low for vtubers to watch but I am the most content about Hololive so I stuck with them the most.

After I got into an accident in my delivery job, I felt like everything had come crashing down at me, I was depressed and mad for 7 fucking months with my toxic friends, and that's when the fire nation [HoloEN] attacked. I could feel myself falling deeper and deeper after their Debuts.

Kiara struck me the most with how much I could relate to her. I started watching and waiting every day whenever there was a stream, but she German Suplex me right where the first SC reading started, seeing that one person saying about "flow" angered me, but I don't blame them, they are allowed to have their own opinions. I cried a lot during that stream, and then after that stream I got to be the second person to call her “Tenchou!”, one of my proudest moments! Initially, I joined the main server, but quickly realized it wasn’t my kind of server, until I arrived here. I was supposed to be stealing emotes but now I'm here crying while typing this. Y’all are such wholesome people, my passions, my funs, it started to come back to me, thank you for all that you all have done for me, I will always remember you as part of my memory.


# ZEPHYR KITTEN

So in the past I've been a bit of a negative Nancy. It always felt easier to complain and whine than say nice things at times. I just have had a hard time wording compliments or positive words because I always have this voice in my head telling me "that doesn't sound genuine, that sounds awkward, don't post that." So a lot of the time I would chicken out and not post words of encouragement I really wanted to say, even if I had a burning desire to do so. And while it may seem hyperbolic to say "WOW MY ENTIRE LIFE CHANGED IN JUST TWO MONTHS AFTER WATCHING A VIRTUAL GIRL" I really do feel much more impassioned to say what I feel. I want to try and be more positive and make people feel good like I always wanted to. I want to post things that will warm people's hearts, even if that obnoxious voice in my head says "NO, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HATE THIS AND YOU'LL ONLY BE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF!" I'm sick of being a negative nancy, and I'm going to do everything I can to be a brighter person.


Kiara just works so goddamn hard to entertain her fans, and just the pure tenacity she has is just insane. That's what I love about her the most, just how genuine she is and how she makes me and her other fans feel like actual people and not just faces in a crowd. Even with tens of thousands of viewers I feel like she's speaking directly to me, and I hope it's the same for you guys too. She's your friend and my friend, and it's important to stick by your friends. Support her at her worst and tease her at her dorkiness. But most importantly, and this is so incredibly cheesy it practically hurts to type, KEEP BEING YOURSELF. Kiara is able to be herself because all of you guys do too. You're all cool, so keep kicking butt!


# ZTHINKER

So why do I love Kiara ? Man, what’s not to love about Kiara ?

I discovered Hololive in just August with Pekora and I fell down the hole after seeing all the girls. I wasn't a big fan of vtubers (not an anti, just that I didn't see the point of liking them) but I discovered that they are girls full of personalities, fun and especially humanity. They show their weaknesses at one point and I think we don't deserve those moments of humanity in an era where we keep trying to meme 'til there's only bones. That part of the internet kinda sucks. At that point, the 5th gen of Hololive appeared and the accident happened there and I felt sad but more focused about it.

A friend talked about the announcement of Hololive English and showed me the characters. I was like "holy shit, they're actually opening overseas ?". We talked a lot about the new characters like how Ina was made by one of the artists of Fate GO (I didn't care but I loved the design). And we talked about Kiara, the fact that she was drawn by huke, the man behind the art for Stein's;Gate and Black Rock Shooter. I was like "they fucking went money for this project". Because of this, I was waiting for the debuts. I saw some memes in reddit about the pre-debut tweets : Gura’s "a", the "it's small" from Amelia and the silly faces Kiara made. I was totally hyped.

And then came the day of the debuts. I loved them all. Calli made a huge impression on me and gave me so much trust.

Kiara also made one with her joyful attitude and her fangirling with Pekora. I mean, Pekora is an incredible vtuber so it's normal.

And she knew how to speak English, German, Japanese and bird. That's incredible, I only learnt two.

She loved Bakemonogatari. Fuck, she has some good taste.

And she sang well.

But to be honest, she wasn't my favorite at the start. I mean, I loved Calli because her rap was so good.

But I liked Kiara. I also liked Ina's chill, Gura's voice and how she makes me laugh and the weirdness of Ame when she was freaking coffee-intoxicated.

At that point, I had FIVE GIRLS to watch. That's a lot. I kinda chose to watch some stuff I loved, beginning with Calli's first stream and Kiara was the guest. It was a really good stream and after the first collaboration which was awkward, you could sense their friendship in that one. The teasing from Kiara in love with Calli was really funny and DAMN SHE RICKROLLED ME! FUCK THAT'S FUNNY MAN.

And I started to watch more of her streams. And more. And more. And I loved the bird to the point she got my SuperChat virginity on the 28th of September 2020. It was the first stream of Minecraft. Man she was so funny there. But the more I watched, the more she kept being open and showing herself. I was charmed by the light she kept showing, how nice she was and all.

It kept going. Maybe that's the whole thing I like from her. That bird brain, the jokes and roasts she has.

You may have seen a lot of jokes about bottom left and yes, she's lewd. Yes, she is ditzy at times. But man, you can't say she's fully stupid. She has that ability to make you learn life lessons. I keep remembering the time in a Fire Emblem stream about reaching people you don't like and how some talk can resolve everything. The most recent was that pep-talk about motivation and D-word and it sparked a light in the community. Man, she cried for a person who may have disappeared and instead of, just believing it's fake, she rolled with it and made an emotional word for it. It was the turning point where I was "Yeah, that's the one I simp for."

It's crazy that she fills her role as a Tenchou. She guides her community and makes it grow. I was kinda scared of joining the KFP discord server because I'm not good in large places. But seeing how you are, I was dumb. How couldn't I trust the guys and gals who followed Kiara ? I thought she showed the best of us and that's amazing.

You know what I love the most in her? Everything. Her whole personality, her content, her community. Fuck it. Everything. Thank you, Kiara, and thank you KFP. You kinda made me build confidence and move on from my bad relationship. I won't be as present as before but I'll try my hardest to represent this community with you.


# ASVERD

I was already deep enough in the rabbit hole that I watched all the EN debuts as they happened, initially fearing cringe and then having my expectations completely subverted. I liked the five girls well enough, but I just found that Ina and Kiara's tastes were the closest to mine and, after a couple streams, Kiara had won me over completely. For me, it's the raw happiness and passion she shows every time, she's truly one of us chasing her dream. And as someone who has already chased his dream and found it pretty unsatisfying in the end, watching someone get the professional and emotional payoff that she deserves is kind of cathartic, I guess. I'm not good at relating to people or expressing my feelings, but fuck me if I don't want to support her all the way


# KESTREL

It all started on the day of my birth, both of my parents failed to show up. Ok, enough joking around. (sorry, if there’s cringe)

I first started watching Hololive around a month before the debut of Gen 5. Started by watching Fubuki, then Coco, never having thought to watch the others. When Gen 5 debuted, I expanded a little and began to watch them, mostly Botan as she played a lot of FPS games. Still, I didn’t really put much thought into Hololive. I only watched them when I felt like it at that point in time. Then, the EN branch debuted. I subbed to all of them as I thought, “Hey, might as well support the new branch”. I watched all of the debuts live, even with the trouble of waking up early in the morning because of time zones. Due to the EN branch, I did keep on coming back to watch Hololive. I would watch Ame because FPS games, Gura not so much but the karaoke was fun, Calli ..well, she didn’t really stream much at first but it’s understandable. Ina- I really can’t because she streams super early for me. Then, there’s Kiara. I admit, she didn’t really attract me much at first. However, the more I watched her, the more my love for her grew. I want to support her as much as I can. Just watching her brings joy to me. Her personality keeps drawing me in. Then, I discovered pre-chat. God, the pre-chat was wholesome and fun. Seeing how everyone there was super friendly to one another and how they supported Kiara really sealed the deal for me. I realized that all of this happened due to one incredibly amazing and talented individual. Because of her just being her, she managed to create such an amazing community that really supports her and just wishes the best things for her. Don’t get me started on the way she interacts with her fans. She really loves her fans as much as her fans love her. I’m proud to be a part of KFP and I’m proud that we are one big happy cu—family.


# KIRYU

Found Hololive when Fubuki did her Scatman thing, subbed for haha funnies, went back to Twitch to watch Dark Souls for a couple months, got bored and looked up dark souls on Youtube and found Haato Dark Souls, subbed to her, Ayame, Flare, Aqua and Pekora, stayed for Haato Minecraft

Simped a bit, got glued to FFXIV, kept an eye on holo through clips, started simping again but for Matsuri and Pekora

A few months of that EN popped up and subbed to them all 3 days before debut, mostly excited for Kiara cause the interesting design and the eyes

Debut hits, accent won me over, personality too

Why Kiara tho, mostly cause she's one of us, and her energy is crazy how it affects others


# TYROKI

In the beginning, I wasn't exactly a stranger to VTubers. I didn't know what they were, but I was a fan of Kizuna Ai some years prior. Not her main channel, as that was really just idol stuff, but her gaming channel and the many entertaining clips held within.

After a year or two, I drifted away from her. It wasn't anything in particular enough to remember why. In the end, I think her material didn't really change and my interest ended up elsewhere. The vTuber scene wasn't really much more than her, and while she was an interesting concept in and of herself, I think that part of the problem could have been the language barrier. She was often fan-translated back then, but it could take days, and waiting for something just released wasn't particularly fun.

My life was quite up in the air, and I didn't know what was going on most of the time. I spent years no longer grounded in reality, just gaming and doing nothing else. For years, I couldn't use my voices. "Shut up", "you're too loud", "you're weird." It just made the world grey.

Over the following years, I did nothing but follow controversies left, right and center. I'd grown angry at the constant politics spewing across the internet, the endless Outrage Mob, the complete and utter idiocy that people consistently spouted regardless of what political camp they existed in, and regardless of what country they lived in. I grew to be quite toxic, watching toxic communities on all sides spread misinformation and try to one up each other. That's toxic by my own standards, mind you. Not someone else's.

I continued watching videos, reading articles, viewing streams of various governments and their popcorn worth shenanigans. The House of Commons in the UK was a particular favourite. I grew ever more frustrated at the steaming pile of shit that was the world. Yes, I watched people like Hero Hei from time to time, knowing full well the kind of person he was, because I didn't really care what effect he had on anything he covered. A lot of what I watched were thanks to the Youtube algorithm ever pushing content after you've watched someone once. "Oh, you watched this person once? You want me to fill your suggested videos with them, right?"

My first introduction to Hololive was through Gigguk, though I didn't really pay much attention. People only speaking in Japanese? I don't understand Japanese, and have long struggled to learn, so that wasn't exactly interesting without translations. Of course I didn't know about LiveTLs back then, though LiveTLs aren't exactly consistently available. Gigguk focused on Coco, but she sounded loud and obnoxious at the time. She is, but I was very wrong about her personality and how awesome she is. But overall, I was put off.

It wasn't until Youtube decided to show me yet another Hero Hei video after I'd long cast him off as the misinforming vulture he is that Youtube decided to show me another of his videos. Normally by that point I'd just ignore it, too lazy to tell youtube to stop showing me his videos. He hadn't popped up in weeks or more. But something about it was interesting. "Gura Fans are Lolicons". He was covering that chick who was trying to spread hate toward Gura for being like a kid, a chick who definitely wasn't a fan, and very much didn't seem to be trying to drum up interest in Gura through controversy.

So I finally decided to look into whatever this Hololive nonsense was. I couldn't see what the chick was on about, but that first taste of Gura's entertaining personality through clips and then the archives drew me in. At first I only flicked through her archives like the pages of a book I wasn't quite interested in, but soon I would be watching her content consistently, and very much enjoyed it.

Soon I was discovering the other girls in The Myth through the Collab VODs. Kiara was the most off putting to me at first. Her early behaviour, that stubborn attitude, being unwilling to ever admit defeat despite it being obvious she'd lost, amongst other personality traits just seemed endlessly obnoxious to me. At least, initially.

Yet the more I was subjected to her through the collabs, the more I came to enjoy her content, and the more I appreciate her work and the way she did things. Then came the appreciation of her personality. The more I learned about her, the more I came to see how kind, caring and considerate she could be (and very much was back then). I began to comment on her vids, actually managed to catch her live because she was on later when no one else I could understand was on, and started getting very involved with her pre-chat community.

The more I watched, the more I chatted, the more I came to enjoy the community. I began to explore more of the Usagi Hole, coming to enjoy this mess of an industry and it's wacky, and wonderful, glory.

A week or two in, despite financial troubles, I borrowed the $6 needed to become a member, working the expense into my already low budget after medical expenses. I live in New Zealand, so those are off-set somewhat by our social systems, but it's still rough when you don't have much money to begin with.

I spent my time trying to come up with memes for pre-chat to make use of, or to modify/streamline existing memes. Bok bok chu, water check at 10 minutes, flush at 5 minutes (though pre-chat started early sometimes). People helped me out, simping for me as Kiara would call it, throwing my suggestions and other fun comments into Super Chats for me. I wanted to be more involved. It was all so much fun, and I was really starting to feel like colour was returning to my life. I started messing with my voices again, regardless of what anyone around me said, which just applied jet boosters to the fun I was having.

Then came the day when I was told how to set filters for Live Chat, allowing me to catch LiveTLs much more easily. I decided that as a test, I would take the ever-loving piss. I began to use the [EN] tag to have some fun during pre-chat for the Kiara x Rushia collab. I made Rushia out to be some kind of bird in the distance. I moved on to taking the piss out of Kiara in the same way, all in good fun of course. Naturally she showed up in the middle of it, and fired Judas... again. I made her out to be some sort of large bird-like predator, out hunting lowly prey. I was jokingly asked to make it an actual documentary, though at the time I had zero knowledge of making videos, and couldn't draw worth a damn. I needed sounds, and was directed to the discord. Fancords often keep a collection of recordings from their streamer, and it was a wealth of sounds.

No one believed that I would actually show up, until I did. I took the documentary idea very seriously, but while I tried numerous times to put it together, I had a lot of issues with my microphone setup. I got into debt, improved my kid dramatically so that it could handle my voices, and here we are. Ready to finally get things done after all this time.

A lot of things have happened since. I can't really watch Kiara live anymore due to timezones. New Zealand and Australia are Oceania. For me, it's JP+3 (or +4 for our DST). That puts streams squarely in the 2am+ mark. Kiara used to alternate timezones, but now she doesn't and it's too hard to keep up now. But I do try to catch her in collabs.


# RETO

Before Hololive, I knew next to nothing about Discord, but after becoming so invested in these people who I somehow connected with so strongly, I wanted to connect with others with whom I could share my interest and fascination. I was an active member of the Botan fan discord, during which they made a Minecraft server for the community to play on. It was also during this time that they announced a Minecraft building contest for Botan's birthday coming up. I knew that this was something I could take part in as well as a way that I might be able to show my appreciation for Botan and Hololive as a whole. But what to make?

I resolved to make a statue of Botan and it was going to be the most extra statue I could make. But as much as I tried different designs, nothing felt right. This is when I decided to make a Minecraft skin of Botan and to use that as my reference for the build: a simple 1:2 statue.

Long story short, I won the contest and had a cute skin to use as a result, but little did I know that soon enough Hololive was about to get bigger

HololiveEN

Admittedly, I was skeptical. I'd seen many girls on YouTube do the "cute anime voice" thing and it never rubbed me the right way. I was worried that HoloEN would be cringe of the highest calibre, but I kept my mind open and marathoned every debut.

Interestingly enough, I was drawn to Kiara ever since she started posting on Twitter. Something about her felt different and her design struck me in a way I couldn't let go of. I was pleasantly surprised to see that every member surpassed my expectations, even blew them out of the water, but Takanashi Kiara was something else. She felt so genuine and so kind that I knew this was the one. I eagerly joined the KFP fan discord server after anxiously waiting for it to appear in the #related_links channel in Botan's server.

Of course my admiration for Kiara only grew as I watched her more and I saw that she was such a pleasant person to listen to and engage with, not to mention the way she seems to care so much for those who watch her. It's something I'd never seen before and something I wasn't particularly used to, given that my experiences with Hololive up until now had been very one-sided. It very honestly felt like she cared as much as we did

To top it off, I knew that as the days tarried on, they were going to eventually play Minecraft. I'd only made one skin before, but admittedly I was proud of it. I felt like I finally had something that I could use to show Kiara, HoloEN, and all of Hololive how much I cared for and supported them. I'd never considered myself creative or artistic, so the idea that I could finally give back was exhilarating. I resolved that I would make Kiara a Minecraft skin, though I feel I have to mention that I resolved to do so with no expectation for her to use it or to even reply to me. I fully intended for her to see it, give it a like, and know that someone cared enough to make something for her, like all other fanart. That would've been enough for me.

Imagine my surprise when she saw it and wanted to use it! Imagine how it must've felt to watch a stream where a huge YouTuber was using something you made! Imagine how it must've felt for thousands to see your creation on the big screen! Imagine how it must've felt for dozens of people on the discord server to say such nice things about you! Imagine how it must've felt for one moment in your life that you felt like somebody. That something you did mattered.

It really was just a Minecraft skin, but feeling that appreciation and all that encouragement really got to me. I truly had never felt that before. I bawled like a baby for at least a half-hour, watching her stream through bleary eyes. I never intended to keep going, but everyone kept on saying, "Reto. You're going to finish the job right? Of course you are." I didn't wanna disappoint, and I seriously didn't expect any other HoloEN member to want to use my skins, but I tried anyway. It was the least I could do in appreciation for the community, friends, and meaning Hololive gave me.

Through all this, I realized that I have talents that I never knew I had before. It's made me rethink what I am capable of. I always thought when I graduated college the only thing I could do is work a boring job working with numbers because that's all I've ever been good at. Hololive helped me realize that I do have a creative side and it's been dying to be let free for years. I want to draw, I want to write, I want to sing, I want to do so many things that I never would've had the guts to pursue if it weren't for these pngs I found on YouTube one day. I'd found something special.


These days I find myself meeting and discovering new vtubers everyday. Many of them have requested skins for me and many have been generous enough to show me that my work has value and donated money as compensation for my efforts. And many of them I just like to hang out with, including Kiara, of course. I've never been social or especially inclined to want to reach out to others, but now I can't get enough of it. I want to connect with everyone. I want to meet everyone. I want to share my talents with others and spread as many smiles and good vibes as I can. That's really been the goal the whole time and I'll be darned if I let that go.


# WEREMORE 02

don't mind me, I'll just talk about how I got in here

ok so, Tbh I don't remember when I exactly knew about hololive, but there was Kizuna Ai. I think after I watched a few vids of her with Joey, I think I came across the video where the girls were jumpscared. Fast forward a few months later, and I came across the perfect guide to hololive video. But the one who got me into the hole was Suisei, because her tetris skills were amazing. I decided to search up more about her and from there, that's how I fell in the hole.

When Holomyth was announced, Kiara caught my eye because of her belt. I was hoping to get a Kamen Rider version of one of the girls. I was a bit disappointed when she didn't transform in her debut, but it was still fun nonetheless.

I missed a few streams because of my lessons, but hey, the archives were there lol.

And fast forward a few months later, and I'm here I guess. that's all.



# CMDR WOLFJAEGER

Gonna shoot it to you straight fam, I have not been vibing to the best times this past year, or the past three years really. Had to move from a place where I had true friends to a place that was cold, overbearing, and difficult. Fast forward a few years and I find myself in a relatively good spot again with new friends, new family, and great experiences to add to my resume. And then the boogaflu attacked.

Nearly everything started to crumble around me. I was thrown into a dark place where I lost all that I had worked to regain over the past few years. After learning from last time, I decided to ride the waves, with hope in my mind that this illness was small enough to be cleaned up after two months. During the summer I was able to find some new ways to vibe, with a new job and a slow return back to my gaming goblin ways. My final semester of Undergrad college started in August, still feeling the effects of the big bad coouf. And that was in August, just a short bit before all of my perceptions of vtubers and streamers in general were completely blown out of the water.

 I have a vague idea of how I got launched into the vtuber world. The first things I remember were seeing Kizuna AI clips floating around years ago alongside clips of Hatsune Miku. This started before I was even interested in Anime in the slightest, so I avoided it all. Fast forward a couple years and I started watching anime because some good friends were into it. Fast forward another year and I get spammed with a handful of Senzawa clips that for some reason would not stop infiltrating my YouTube recommendations. I watched a few, visibly cringed, and moved on. About 2-6 months later Projekt Melody debuted and became the TALK of the WHOLE INTERNET. This is about when I started watching some “controversy” news Youtubers.

Then Gigguk came along with the trash taste podcast. Seeing as how I really liked his quarterly anime reviews, and seeing that Chris from Abroad in Japan was in the podcast as a guest, I decided to follow along and watch the podcasts. From there I learned how Gigguk simped for Coco, and that kickstarted YouTube‘s recommendation algorithm for me. I had a handful of videos pop up about the big Hololive the block, but most of them were about the controversy or funny DOOG posting. It was around September when this all started happening for me, around the same time when the EN talents debuted. I missed their debut streams, but after getting past all the controversy and hearing how the Trash Taste guys loved the Vtubers, I decided to look into Hololive EN and see what the hype was about.

I joined the “HOLOLIVE RESISTANCE” discord server after seeing enough clips of Holo-vtubers and started vibing in there. Hit a point where I started getting a bit bored. Then in came Rule #7 breaking information like a TRUCK. I became curious about all the HoloEN talents after the YouTube algorithm led me to a video about the background of one of the girls. Curiosity got the better of me and at that point I quickly fell into a hole of “despair”, and in my head the magic was gone. I was lost in a sea where I felt that they were “fake”, “acting” and putting up a huge performance just to get views and money.


After 2 or 3 days the girls had their first big Minecraft collab and in my state of boredom and wanting to stop being sad about my whole ordeal, I decided to tune in to watch. Started watching Calli, and I noticed her interactions with Kiara being the best out of the bunch. I started watching the girls’ streams again slowly but surely, and started enjoying their content with an oddly greater appreciation than before.

Onto Kiara specifically: there was a poll that some Vtuber clipper put up on YouTube asking: Who of the Hololive EN girls would you want to be best friends with? I took that question to heart and thought long about it. I first chose Amelia because I have a good friend who is very much like her, but something didn’t feel right. I then shortly changed my vote over to Kiara after thinking a bit longer, realizing “Hey, she’s actually a really cool girl, and everyone needs that goofball of a best friend.” From there I started watching Kiara content with a bit more enthusiasm.

Eventually, I was tired of only having 1-3 emotes only for Kiara by being in the HOLOLIVE RESISTANCE server, so I followed the link to join the Kiara Discord server. I don’t know exactly what happened but I just remember the chat being super welcoming and wholesome, so I was super happy and wholesome in return, which led to my first ban for being too wholesome. Ahhh the memories.

Anyways. The longer I stayed in this server, the more I was slowly indoctrinated into following our queen of Fried Chicken, Frau Kiara. I have since let most of my walls down, but try to keep some semblance of decency because all of you are too dang wholesome, and I can’t help but be wholesome to you guys. This server has literally helped change my life into a much more positive setting than before, and has been so much of a blessing that even with all the nonsense that has been happening to me in 2020, I will remember this community and the HoloEN girls the most, because of how much y’all changed things around for me.

Also shoutout to the Trash Taste Podcast because they threw me into this Pekora hole.


# Inkless

I got into Hololive a few months back, shortly before Gen 5 debuted. My friend sent me some funny videos about a fox and a dog, and a rabbit hurling a rare item into lava. I was charmed by the cute characters and sought out more on my own, but the more I got into it the more I realized how human the connection really was between the members of Hololive and their communities. It wasn't like most streamers, keeping people at arm's length. It was like using the avatar to let them take off their other masks and be their genuine self in front of a crowd. And honestly, it was some of the most wholesome content I had ever seen in my life. I watched the Gen 5 premier and got hooked properly, seeing for myself where so many of the others had gotten their start, the transition from those first floundering steps to establishing their brands and styles. I branched out into older generations, stuck my head in here and there, and found more and more to love about the brand, the community and the performers. The thing that crystallized it for me, that made me want to pay for the entertainment I was receiving, was Kiara. I have a thing for underdogs, and redheads, but more importantly I have a thing for people with hearts too big for their chests. I see Kiara streaming, worrying over how well she's doing, whether people like her, whether she's good enough for the support she receives, and my own heart aches a bit, knowing that she's all that we say she is and more. One of my friends tried to intentionally spoil my fun by doxxing her, throwing whatever he could find my way to "shatter the illusion", but at the end of the day all it did was reinforce my support for where she's at now. It was the humanity in Hololive that made me want to watch it, not the "illusion", and seeing more of that humanity in the pasts and stories of the performers only makes me smile harder when they talk about how happy they are to be living the life they have. And that's my story.

I guess the first time I saw Kiara and instantly wanted to support her was when two of my friends were competing on who simps harder on Gura. I never knew HololiveEN was a thing yet, and only watched HoloJP clips from time to time.

Watching one of Gura's streams was actually pretty fun. I didn't know that I would be watching a Vtuber for 2 hours in my life, and only then did I realize she was from Hololive. I didn't know there already were idols who spoke English, so I checked the other members (this was when I fell down the rabbit hole permanently lmao).

I subscribed to everyone in HoloEN immediately and watched their debut. But Kiara really caught my eye on this one. The reason wasn't really the fact that the Phoenix is my favorite mythical creature, but she just seemed to pop off in my perspective from the five.

All of them, including JP, CN, ID, and HoloStars are great too, don't get me wrong, but Kiara's  stream vibes were just my taste. She's fun to listen to, very chaotic, wholesome, and translates for the JP audience (that's some talent). I even remember the stream where she got criticized for self translating herself for the JP Bros, but I think that's bull. For that, Kiara inspired me to relearn Japanese again, and here I am, mastered Hiragana and Katakana in a month, and starting to learn basic Kanji.

Her streams were really at convenient times for me, maybe because JP time is just 1 hour ahead of my time. There I got to experience the feeling of wanting to support an idol, for the very first time. She exerts effort for everyone like how that one McDonalds employee gives 2-3 nuggets in their boxes, it was crazy. Her extrovertedness even affected my personality a bit to the point where I talk my mind more than usual.

This point in my life was probably one of the lowest this year. Because of stressful school tasks and serious medical attention (in a better place now), I haven't been really doing things passionately like I used to. But for some reason, I still go to Kiara. Even if I'm tired, I go to her streams and just laugh with her. It's like seeing your bed once again after traveling 12 hours in a bus. I guess you can say watching her was a recreational activity for me.

After all those pain-in-the-back events, I'm still here, excitedly waiting for her Single and HoloTALK events this upcoming week. If Kiara does read these in the future, thank you for being so... you! You can say you saved my life here, it hasn't been this bright in some months. -KazeMir

Throughout my life, I never found myself interested in people I’ve never met. I saw how people were really invested in celebrities, idols, seiyus, and streamers, but I never understood them. I’d think the people were cool and interesting, but that’s about it. I was never interested in really supporting anyone and seeing their journey unfold. Going into vtubers back in July I expected it to be the same thing where I would just appreciate the stuff they do, and that’s as far as my emotional investment would go. At first it was like this. I went between Suzuhara Lulu, Kiryu Coco, Haachama, and when Gen 5 came, I got interested in Polka. When EN came around though things changed.

I spent the first week watching everyone’s streams live to see what they were like. I did mess up my sleeping schedule because of it, but it was definitely worth it. Watching the EN streams was fun since I could understand everything without needing chat TLs or clips for once. As time went on, I found myself really invested in Kiara. You could tell that she wore her heart on her sleeve, and it made it really fun to watch her. Her happiness and frustration were infectious, and I’d find myself cheering and shouting along with her at times. It was the most enjoyment I felt out of seeing someone doing something they enjoyed. I found myself at the edge of my seat wanting to see what was next, and she really delivered.


Her streams had their ups and downs, and there were moments where she opened up to us about what was troubling her. Even if she thought she might be saying too much, I really appreciated that she felt she could talk with us about what she was going through. It was nice that we could make a safe space for her, and even though she was streaming for us, I was glad we could give back in the form of emotional support. Seeing her sad from that SC about her live TLs, her feeling insecure about her place and talent made me want to support her with everything I had. Even more so with all of her technical issues at the beginning. She was able to fix them eventually, but it really stressed her out as it was going on. The FE stream she privated was a good example of the issues she faced, while also showing how tenacious she is. She’s a really hardworking emotional bird, who has high standards for herself, and she’s really someone to look up to. I knew this bird would go places and I wanted to see where she’d take us. I decided early on that she would be the first person I’d get a membership for, and that she’d be my first SC. I’ve loved seeing her grow these past 2 months now, and she’s brought a lot of happiness to my life. This isn’t even getting started on the community she fostered.


Being part of the KFP server is one of the things I’m most grateful for this year. I’ve never been part of an online community, but I feel so at home here at KFP. There are names I remember from being here everyday, and I love seeing everyone fool around while also supporting our Tenchou and each other. It’s seriously a family, and I feel like I belong. Everyone’s encouraging each other making clips, art, Minecraft skins etc. It’s a really supportive place to be, and I’m happy people are pursuing things that give themselves happiness, and also giving it to those around them. Someone was even kind enough to gift me their extra copy of Minecraft, and the KFP Minecraft server became my first time playing with other people. It was so much fun being with my fellow employees. Seeing the stuff they’d make, and doing my part to help them make what they wanted was really fulfilling. Also got to chat with people more individually that way. I remember being welcomed into the starting settlement by General Pekorin, and I remember when Tum gave me my first diamond pick while I worked on the Book Hall in Vogel. It was just a pick, but I felt really touched by it. People inviting me to join them in the villages they were starting made me feel so welcomed. It’s been a great place to be, and whenever I find myself being stressed, I can definitely just hop into the discord server to calm my nerves.


VIVA LA KIARA! VIVA LA KFP!!

I believe, like a lot of my fellow employees, I was led towards the rabbit hole by clips of cute girls doing funny things. Around two months before HoloEN debuted, I wasn’t watching any Vtubers and only knew them through said clips. I heard news of the HoloEN debuts,  got interested and finally decided to watch the debuts and give this whole thing a go... after all what could possibly happen, right? One particular member caught my attention immediately. The reason might sound a little dumb, but it was Kiara and her first language being german, my mothertongue. I decided to subscribe to her and then proceeded to forget about vtubers for a while as I got busy IRL.

A few days later, I saw the [Karaoke Party] livestream and even though the sound quality wasn't the best and some hiccups happened, her voice and personality was endearing enough to make me continue watching. I decided to watch more Vtubers and caught streams here and there of different EN members until I found my favorite in Kiara. That opinion was only solidified further as I saw her in collabs with the EN girls, her dynamic in groups and finally her wholesome, funny, lewd and sometimes yabai superchat readings. She made me fall completely. I couldn‘t stop watching her streams as Kiara overcame her early setbacks and self doubts. I took joy in seeing her grow and shine brighter, and decided to join her membership and the KFP discord.

 

Today I can‘t imagine how different things could have been, had I never watched, or decided to not give her a chance for technical difficulties or other reasons. I believe I would have regretted not knowing her or the KFP family. At this point I enjoy everything she does, for who she is and find joy in participating in events organised by the KFP family for celebrations, be it drawing, singing and talking. I didn't know I could enjoy this much. Probably a simple way to end up at this point, so let me end this simply for my Oshi  too.

Viva la Kiara

When I fell into the rabbit hole of Hololive, it was hard to find a community to share all of my artwork. Especially with the styles that I make, pixel art and 8bit, a.k.a. retro style. So whenever I made a pixel art, I shared it with my friends that brought me to the Hololive experience.

Then one day, my friend told me that there will be a new group called Hololive English. I watched all the debut streams and eventually fell into HoloEN. One day while we were speaking,  my friend asked "Hey! Why not share your pixel art and your 8-bit covers of hololive related things on twitter?"At the time, I didn’t think that anyone other than our small friend group would enjoy it as it wasn’t “cool”, but  he was like, "Just try it." And so I posted my 8bit covers of all HoloEN's Loading Screen BGM on twitter with my pixel art on it.

 Fast forward to the first HoloEN Minecraft collab, after the GREAT TUNNELING stream, I decided to make a minecraft 3d art of it. It caught the attention of Kiara, who asked  "That is so cool, how do you do these things? They look so cinematic lmao ''. I replied that I used a program called Mine-imator, which really did everything I needed it to. Someone else commented that they used to watch 3D minecraft animations back in the day, and that gave me the idea to learn how to do that. Lo and behold, The “Kiara's Roommate” Animation was made, and I unlocked a new achievement/skill to make 3d animations.

After releasing the Roommate Animation, someone commented that he was trying to reach out to me about a project that he was working on. So I contacted him and was told that he had seen my Kiara Loading BGM 8bit and he wanted me to join his project. I asked him for further details, decided to join, and here I am: An art director of Besto Friend Team for our upcoming game called Idol Showdown: A Hololive 2d Retro Fighting Fan Game.

Without Kiara and HoloEN in general, maybe I would still be stuck in that phase of being too shy to share everything and wouldn’t have been discovered by the game developer of Idol Showdown. So Thank you Kiara and to all HoloEN.


# Sly

So my first contact with Hololive was the Azur Lane collab actually, although I don't remember what I thought about it at the time. Later, I found Lyger’s channel and started watching some Matsuri clips from there as well as a few other clippers as well and eventually got to know a lot of the members. But the only actual streams that I watched were Haachama relaxing minecraft ones, for example the one that she built the church for her wedding with Watame, cause she actually spoke a bit of english sometimes. My favorites before HoloEN would be Pekora, Marine, Hachama, Ayame and Watame.

When the auditions for holoEN were announced, I thought “well good luck with that”, the magic of the vtubers is that they kept out of politics and are just there to entertain. The western side of the internet couldn't possibly do it. And then they were revealed, by design I was liking Ina and Gura, the others weren’t as eye-catching I would say. So I would give it a shot without expectations and see what happens.

So Kiara, the first thing that caught my attention was the ease that she switched between japanese and english, then her excitement when Huke spoke in the chat, and then she mentioned that her favorite was Pekora. Well you had my curiosity, but now you have my attention. What a fangirl we have here. One of us! Also the anime and JRPGs  that she enjoys overlap a bit with mine so that helped.

There wasn't an exact stream that set her as my favorite, it's just all of it together i would say, her karaoke high notes, her endless supply of energy, her interaction with the fans, she’s just an all around very fun and good human being that i can't help but want to keep cheering on. And just like that, I haven't missed a stream, and I'm always eager for more.

Her ability to make such an engaging and fun stream  that nothing else matters at that moment is so important to me because I'm an overthinker so it really helps being able to keep my mind offline. And even more important,she’s so genuine, yes she’s playing a character  but she doesn't shy away from being real with us and letting some of her real feelings through.

So much more I could write here but this is getting long.

So yes, I’m a Kiara simp and I'm proud of it.I want to see this girl fulfil her dream.

Now about you guys here at KFP, it's very nice seeing everyone getting along nicely, and I hope it continues like this for a very long while. It's so wholesome to see a group that just like me wants to see this beautiful Phoenix succeed in her endeavours.

I do not talk much but I do appreciate you guys.

VIVA LA KIARA!


# Poem2self

My journey started with having my brother, who I have a close relationship with, watching Hololive around April 2020. I had been aware of the existence of vtubers since Kizuna ai was a thing, but brushed it off as a stupid silly meme. He'd show me clips (like Haachama singing Shape of You) or annoying fans constantly requesting Jojo songs in karaoke but I never really looked into it myself.

Fast forward to August 13th, 2020. Me and my brother were up in the middle of the night and he's watching Minato Aqua play Ocarina of Time, so I decided to tune in myself. And what I saw, was not only quite possibly the worst Zelda gameplay I have ever seen but also the funniest content ever in a way. It's hard to describe but it hit all the marks for me in terms of comedic value; cute girls doing things and making a fool of themselves.

So I'm sitting here, wondering "Why am I enjoying this? Why is this so cute and funny to me? I love this!" and I was immediately hooked. It was crazy to me, because I used to hate streaming and streaming culture but this was a whole new thing to me. The very next day, I sent my first superchat ever to Aqua, telling her that her American fans loved her, because I sure as hell did.

At this point I was only into Aqua and Watame, but my brother told me about the auditions for Hololive EN and how they would be debuting in less than a month. Unfortunately the only ones I could catch live were parts of Gura's and Watson's but I ended up watching the VOD of Calliope's debut. And I remember saying "Yep, Calliope is definitely going to be my favourite."

I was proven wrong.

I was able to catch Kiara Takanashi playing Fall Guys live, and was also very interested, however it never really struck me until later what interested me in her.

It was the very next day, I think, a collab between Mori and Kiara. And Kiara just had this energy to her, that couldn't be replicated.(edited)

Her personality and model were bouncy, she was hilarious, incredibly sweet, and her design was gorgeous and even moreso unique! I simply couldn't get enough of those two hats she wore and her colour scheme. She simply had it all, just like Aqua. This combined with her synergy with Mori immediately made her my favourite of all in Hololive.

The great thing is, the bottom left energy isn't her only side. She's extremely friendly and just knows how to lighten a room and spark things in others, with or without being a cute klutz. She can be super down to Earth too, something which I don't see talked about as much.

I've superchatted Aqua once, Mori once, however since then,  I've only superchatted to Kiara since then and multiple times. I joined her membership on the day it came out, played Mario Kart with her on stream, and tuned into countless streams especially the Fire Emblem ones as it is my favourite video game series.

Her cover of A Cruel Angel's Thesis made me watch Neon Genesis Evangelion (yes, really)

I've even connected with a friend through Kiara. This guy who was in a mutual server with me who we only bonded over Fire Emblem with a few times, had sent a superchat. "[Friend] Dankeschön!" Kiara joyfully said. I went straight to discord and asked if it was him, sure enough, Kiara is one of his favourites too.

I could go on for hours about the positive influence Hololive and Kiara have positively impacted my life, but I think I've made my point clear. I've forged friendships, listened to amazing karaoke and have had tons of laughs with friends and family thanks to vtubers and I couldn't be more happy with them. Viva La Kiara!



# Arty

Initially, I fell down the rabbit hole around April with the Fukkireta video featuring all the girls at the time, with Roboco being my first subscription way back in late 2018 before I even knew what Hololive was!

Surprisingly, when I saw the announcement for HoloMyth being an EN branch, I was a little apprehensive at the thought because I thought that it wouldn't be as appealing as the JP talents or that the fanbase for them would be more toxic than that of the prior girls. To be quite honest, I wasn't very interested in Kiara because when I first saw her all I could think of was a E-Girl putting on a fake personality with a voice that was kind of grating against my ears (please forgive me Tenchou), so I kind of skipped her content during the first week, but still subbed because I thought why not. After the first week or so, I wanted to give Kiara another chance and that is when she started growing on me quickly.

I was kicking myself for not giving her much of a chance early on and decided to full on commit to watching all her streams when I am available so I could learn more about her. Discovering that she could speak three different languages was a surprise, her very endearing and genuine personality being able to make us both laugh and our hearts scrunch up whenever it gets a little too real makes her super relatable in the stories that she's told us, and how she just rolls with the chat now with her spot on the chart being chained to the bottom left forever.

TAKAMORI also played a large part in the appeal of Kiara for me as well since I simped our boy, the Reaper apprentice, Calliope Mori as my first membership before I decided on Kiara. The way Kiara and Calli interact provide my brain with a copious amount of serotonin and fill my cold dead heart with the warm fuzzies. Maybe I need to be bonked for all the TAKAMORI content I retweet, but it feels very genuine to me that they can generate such a rapport and real feeling interactions. Kiara has proven to us already that she really cares for others and it is only reinforced since she organized a day for Calli to unwind and relax since she was such a hard-working reaper who could’ve worked herself to death if not for an intervention from Kiara.


Thank you, Kiara, for all the work that you have done so far to build such a wonderful community in the KFP crew. It would have been a lot harder to pass the year without you, Holomyth and Hololive as a whole.


As always, VIVA LA KIARA~



# DogBoyStone

I fell into the rabbit hole of hololive by coming across Minato Aqua on Instagram, I saw a post of her,  thought she was cute and followed the hashtag. I continuously saw posts with that hashtag but with different girls. After I did some research and found out about hololive, I saw some videos but the first stream I really saw was a Coco singing one. I didn’t watch a lot of hololive at the time about 2 months ago. Then some days after the news about Holo-En came out, I discovered it existed. I didn't watch the debuts and I really regretted it after I saw all the holoen girls. They were really cute but the one that got me was Takanashi Kiara: a super cute, goofy, funny, amazing, sweet, entertaining character. I liked and still like everything about Kiara; her knowledge about multiple languages was something that I liked a lot because it was something I had in common with her. I liked her stupendous design, her personality, the way she acts and how she treats so kindly people, but I also like her voice. That super cute voice where a lot of super kind and meant from the heart words come from. Kiara is the hololive member I watch the most and she'll always have a place in my heart. Viva La Kiara o7 my fellow KFP colleagues

So how did I find Kiara and KFP you ask ? Well it’s a short but i think it's a good little story so sit back and enjoy.

The first time I saw a Hololive Member was a (i think Fan made) Video from Fubuki where she plays the Kirby song  with all the different cuts and all. I laughed so hard at it that I think I watched it four times in a row. So after that Video a Friend of mine sent me the link to the video that Gigguk made and I watched it. Then he announced the HoloEN Debuts streams, which surprised me since I didn’t even know that EN was coming. But because of the Fubuki Video and Gigguk, YouTube thought that maybe I would be interested in the Gura Debut stream. And yeah, I liked it so much that for my first week, I watched Gura and the other girls Debuts streams. But when I got to Kiara’s Debut stream, it was a kinda different feeling. I felt an instant sympathy for her. I liked the way she talked, what she had for hobbies and what her goals were at the moment. And yes this sounds a little bit stupid but I saw that she had the lowest sub count from all of the Girls and I said to myself "I want to support this Underdog."  So I subscribed, watched a few Videos, and lurked in the Pre-Chat. When the Singing collab with Nene got announced, I was hyped cause I got to hear her for the first time Singing live. And as I heard her Singing Voice, I  was like "Dang I'm kind of feeling I’m falling down a hole....."


 So yeah this is pretty much all of the story. Nothing special or something, just a Man who's enjoying the Voice of a Phoenix  and the Chaos she brings sometimes.



# WildNexus

Discovering Vtubers has been a bit of a journey for me. I first saw a Kizuna Ai video a few years ago but didn’t think much of it and moved on. A couple years later I saw a few more videos with vtubers (I don’t remember the names) but again moved on. It was not until this year that I really started paying attention. I discovered a few Western indie vtubers and that started me down the path. What officially brought me into the Hololive world was Korone and her Doom clips. Because of Doog I eventually found Coco and her meme reviews.  Even with my growing interest, I never engaged with the talents or the community. Some of it was due to the language barrier, but another reason was that no one around me was (and still isn’t) into vtubers.

While I knew a little bit about the 5th gen, I really began to focus on Hololive once I heard about the debut of Hololive EN. I was working during the debut streams but I went back and watched all of them. Calli completely caught me with her amazing raps and general awkwardness, Ina with her drawings and  calmness, Gura with her cuteness, singing, and the meme, Ame with her weird concoction and gremlin vibe, and last was Kiara. Kiara did pique my interest a little due to her being able to speak multiple languages, her infectious Pekora-inspired laugh, and Steins:Gate design (seriously though why does she have sleeves?). Kiara is now my favorite vtuber, but if I’m honest, she didn’t really catch me in the same way the others did; at least initially.

I did watch her streams, but I was more of a passive viewer. I’d open the stream as something to play in the background during work. I enjoyed the karaoke stream and FallGuys stream, but what turned me around was her first SC reading stream. Seeing how she interacted with her fans and how much of an open person she was/is pulled me in. Even when she was at a low point, it was so genuine that it really resonated with me. I understand that feeling and still struggle with those same doubts. But seeing Kiara still push forward and how her fans returned the support 1000x over was/is amazing. Not out of pity, but out of love and wanting this phoenix to succeed. I felt that, for the first time in a long time, I wanted to openly and actively support a creator. I started to participate in prechat a bit more and engage with the community a little more. Everyone’s welcoming and kind attitudes were really reflective of the kind of place Kiara wanted to make. Watching Kiara stumble, get back up, grow, and succeed thus far has been an experience I have never had in an internet community before. She has earned the adoration of her fans and rightly deserves all the love and support. I’m so proud of how far she’s come and how far she can still go.

One last thing. I know it's sappy but she has inspired me to keep pushing and try things I would have been too shy or not confident to do before. To keep pushing and do things I’m proud of regardless of how others see it. Even if I fail and stumble, I know I can rise up just like our lovely Phoenix.

The Rabbit Hole - My journey to KFP

Hi everyone, I’m Deemo Harlos, a KFP pianist. I want to share my story of how I started to follow HoloLive EN and eventually become deeply connected with KFP.

I first heard about vTubers in the beginning of the year. It did not attract my attention much, since I am neither a fan of game streaming, nor do I understand Japanese well. It was not until a week or two ago when my Facebook was filled with posts about Hololive EN and so that I noticed them. The first thing really caught my eye while searching for more details is Calliope’s Rap “失礼しますが、RIP♡”, which really amazed me with the fluent mix of two languages and the fact that how talented vTubers can be.

And that’s when I slipped into the rabbit hole. Soon later I found myself scrolling through YouTube everyday looking for vTuber clips, especially those of Hololive EN, which are in a language I am familiar with. At first I claimed not to be a DD too soon, but soon after I decided to subscribe to all the five members: Kiara, Calliope, Ina, Gura and Watson.

Let’s make things clear: I do not like them just because they are cute anime girls or something. Each of them had some characteristics that attracted me a lot. In some streams they each told some story about how they became what they are now, and also some life perspectives and lessons. To me, they are not just moving characters on the screen. There are souls in them that give me positive energy. I also respect them for their effort to become what they are to give happiness and love to everyone, and so I look to them.

Soon my daily routine became more chaotic than it was. Many nights I do not sleep at all, just to watch their streams. I can’t help but think Hololive EN just gave me too much happiness I wasn't able to get before.

Kiara Fried Phoenix

At one of Kiara’s streams someone said that there are servers for each member. As a Discord “experienced” user I quickly joined in every one of them. KFP is the most active of all, and I hopped into the voice chat filled with people. It has already been a couple of years since I moved my life focus from reality to the Internet, but getting into a foreign based server is completely a different experience, with a new group of people that have never known anything about myself.

Everyone that I have met in KFP is very friendly and kind to me, which was way more than I had expected. I managed to play piano in the voice chat, and I am very happy to receive many compliments and encouragement, which I did not actually get much before. Also we get to listen to other musicians in KFP, and listening to their performances is a wonderful experience. We also chatted about stuff, helped out someone with relationship problems, and even watched a movie together. In merely four days I have been through so much fun with the new friends. I never wanted to leave the voice chat, and therefore my daily routine has become even MORE chaotic.

Some of my story

I first learned keyboard and basic music theory when I was 7. But after four years or so I stopped learning. It was 15 when I started on the piano, self-taught. And the biggest motivation was this game, Deemo, a wonderful rhythm game. I really liked the music from Deemo, so I looked for free music sheets and tried to practice on my own. In my high school times I joined a wind band as a new learner in percussion, and as my interest in music gradually grew I learned many music theories and composing/arranging techniques.

At university I started to listen to many amazing music YouTubers such as SLSMusic, Animenz, phyxinon, and so on. Gradually the thought of playing piano through the Internet and influencing people with music became one of my life goals.


The truth is that I am neither a confident nor a positive person. I only consider my piano playing decent. Decent yet not enough to stand out from the crowd. I make many mistakes and lack improvising techniques, compared with the music YouTuber I look up to. I know I need time to practice, but thanks to the mental issues and the schoolwork I can barely squeeze time out. I have hard times living my life and spending most of the day dealing with my own emotions. I did see a doctor and take medicine, though I still have to go through the self-hating phasis every day. This feeling gets even worse whenever I see other people shining in their own career, field or talent, especially music, like those in KFP. Many people told me that I do not have to hurry, and that I can walk at my own pace. So many people and things that always remind me that I am walking slower than any other people, and I just can’t get away with it and tell myself it is okay that I do nothing to improve now.

Somebody mentioned something like Holofried or Hololive EN Gen 2. I, of course, clearly knew that I do not have a cute looking or voice. Though that thought of becoming a vTuber indeed went through my mind for a second. But no way. I do not have that kind of personality. Plus, my English speaking kind of sucks. Nevertheless, to some extent I do want to excel myself to the same level as Kiara, all the other Hololive EN members, the music youTubers, and such. I really want to improve myself so that someday I could be at the same level as theirs, and collaborate or cooperate with them in terms of my talents and skills.

Thanks

To Kiara

I know you might not read this, since this is not a superchat anyways. I’ve watched many VODs and clips of yours, so I know many moments that you give inspirational speeches, share life perspectives and talk about your internal feelings. I love how genuine and sincere you are, just like a close friend. Whenever I listen to you talking about how you fight hard to become what you are and that the hard work has finally paid off, I always feel happy for you and want to cry with you. I’ve always wanted to be someone like you, who gives warmth and happiness to others. The difference is just that I wish to do so in terms of music, and that I haven’t succeeded yet.

Though it has only been a couple of weeks since I know you, you have become one of my biggest motivations for doing what I love, and most importantly, living on, just like how Pekora Senpai meant to you.

If you were just a friend of mine I would have just fallen in love (laughs). You have been fighting so hard. Please keep on but also take care as well. It is always okay to rest for a bit.

I love you, Kiara.

To NaGeL

You are the first one that got to me when I was a little broken down then. You are also the first one that donated to me. Thanks a million!

To Akel

Thanks for your drawing! I really love it, though I wish there would be coloring (laughs). Also thanks for supporting my piano playing.

To Nonono / Clan / Egguca and other talented musicians

I really enjoyed your performance. I hope we can collab some day!

To All KFP members

I really have to thank you all for supporting me and encouraging me to play the piano. You guys have been the new spiritual support for me, and KFP has become a new home on the Internet for me. Thank you all. I love you guys.

The journey has just started. Viva la Kiara! Viva la KFP!
