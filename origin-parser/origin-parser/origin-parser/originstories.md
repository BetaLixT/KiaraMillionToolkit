To be perfectly honest, upon first falling into the rabbit hole, it was difficult to find a decent community to any significant extent. Chats in streams were usually stale jokes/strange requests/people being unreasonable.

Comments under clips and on Reddit/Twitter were better, but it wasn't a community per se (at least not in the sense that I was looking for). We all had a common reason, the Vtubers, but something was lacking. The only place with a modicum of solace was with Haachama since I enjoy cursed content.

Until HoloEN came along.

When the girls first debuted, I didn't pay TOO much attention to them. I was under the false and ignorant idea that Hololive should be predominantly Japanese, but also held the belief that the English branch would do decently in and of itself due to the interest from the rest of the world.

Clips were watched, memes were seen and upvoted, fanart was liked and downloaded, but nothing significant.

Then I stumbled onto Takamori. First impressions? "Damn, they've only just started and there is a ship already? Sounds fun, let's have a look!"

The bounciness of Kiara (both her personality and her PERSONALITY) was interesting to me, more so than the other girls. I went on to watch a few archives, streams and clips, and fell into the KFP hole even more, but bear in mind I hadn't discovered the discord yet.

Despite the bottom left memes, which was frankly one of the main reasons I started with Kiara, I found that she was more than mere lewdness and birdbrain moments.

I should have seen that coming with the others like Senchou in mind, but I didn't for some strange reason at that point in time.

I sat there, falling deeper into this hole, wondering, "Why in the name of fuck is this chicken not as popular as the others?"

I did not expect or demand her to rise head and shoulders above the rest, but I was hoping that she would at least be keeping pace (which Kiara did with no issue). Her lack of self-esteem (in the very beginning) and constant impostor syndrome was very relatable, but it still hurt a little bit to see someone beat themselves up like that, when there was no reason to do so.

When her membership opened up, I bought it on that first day. As I continued watching more and more streams, I also noticed something else. Something about the community that was behind her.

I recognised some names. Now, that in and of itself may not seem like much, but consider this. The names that were recognised were not clippers, not verified Youtubers that also happened to be interested in Kiara.

No, none of that.

These were just regular fans, people who loved her, people who supported her, people who enjoyed her content and just wanted to show their support in their own little way. On top of that, I also noticed that the fans themselves interacted with each other and actually seemed to know each other beyond just saying hi in the chat.

I thought they were all from the main Hololive server, so I joined that. Was it fine? I guess so, but there was still something lacking.

Then I found KFPcord. Initially I didn't put too much bother into it, thinking it was merely a "Takanashi Kiara" fan club. But then I started backreading some of the stuff that was said and I don't recall actually finding anything that was toxic/negative/angry, which was in and of itself a rarity in this day and age on the Internet.

And that was when it hit me. Kiara didn't need explosive growth like Gura. What she needed was a solid, stable core of fans that would always be there, pure and simple. Growth is important too, but if there isn't a solid foundation, then the massive structure that is built on those shaky stones will merely come crashing down of its own accord sooner rather than later.

Kiara has come a hell of a long way since it all first started, and I would say that we love her even more than before. She also motivated me to take up clipping, so I have another thing to thank her for. Viva La Kiara!

I started the rabbithole basically with the EN gen. I had seen some clips of the girls and watched Korone stream before, but when the EN debuted I tried giving them a chance, and started watching them all starting with Ame. Incidentally at this point, I saw the least amount of Kiara because as she has said, her timezone was the least convenient. But I tried anyway and enjoyed it, especially the fire emblems and the talking ones, not to mention the Karaoke. I'm pretty sure at that point the amount of videos I watched of her started increasing, and I also found out about the discord here and found people who really cared about her so I started focusing specifically on her. Nowadays I can listen to her for hours and I still need more; I definitely like her bright personality, her moments both seiso and "bottom left", her passion on her work, how much she cares about things going okay, how much she loves calli and the other girls and how much she appreciates KFP. Basically as I said before she's like a warm little sun of endless energy and love and I want every minute of it.

Y'all really gonna make me type. I'm really grateful for Kiara, my first impression of her was in her first Mario 64 stream thinking of "Hey, I really like her, she’s super energetic and cheerful, like a ray of sunshine". After the stream was over, it hit me that, "Damn, I’m sure a lot of people are going to miss this huh, so why not compile the great moments of her and just put them up" and that's when I decided to do her stream highlights. At the beginning it was just for fun and I guess to get her attention (because getting noticed by the person you follow is cool y’know). But when the minecraft stream arrived (the one with the tech issues), I've never felt such a heartbroken emotion like it before. I didn't want to see her sad or upset about what was happening because I know she works a lot and she gives her best each day and in every stream. So I guess that was my push to keep on supporting her with everything I have, so I decided to take the highlight work more seriously and help her shine through. The fact that she has grown this much, and how her personality and actions have been developing throughout the time just makes me proud y’know. She is more cheerful, and knows how to handle things and is more used to this stuff. I still wish I could SC more and support her financially, but I'm glad I can do my part with these clips

I never thought I would be keeping up with someone just to do my best to support them in any way I can, and I'm glad she motivated me to take back editing which has been such a huge part of my life that I thought I lost...

So, I'm grateful to Kiara for literally, everything.

This can be little chaotic as long writings never was my forte

At first I started watching Kiara mainly because of her design (I'm a sucker for phoenixes) and the somewhat EU friendly stream times. I was only watching her in the background when I was doing my own stuff. During that time I would feel guilty leaving during superchat readings.

Until one time when I was too distracted to leave the stream and stayed during the SC reading. I was drawn in by her talk and all of the tangents. That was the day that I decided to actively watch Kiara. As shy of an introvert as I am, At the time I was only lurking in little fear of writing anything. As the time passed, I started to notice changes inside me. After noticing all those fan arts she likes and retweets I kinda grow more appreciation for different styles of art. It also made me want to improve myself as a person and made me want to learn to draw and japanese. Before I noticed I wanted to be an active part of this community. At first I slowly started by simply reacting in live chat to the situation on stream. Later it evolved into me joining the Discord and meeting all you lovely mothercluckers <3. Lately it has evolved into me being active on twitter under Kiara and your tweet

During the early days of her streaming (like right before I joined) during all those technical issues she had, she made me want to support her with my everything, but I wasn’t quite sure how. She took my SC virginity and was the first I became a member with. The way that she interacts with fans and made me want to support even more. At first I pitied her for low sub count but later I realized that it was a blessing in disguise as it solidified her fanbase. I'm really glad to stay with her and see that orange ball of energy that radiates our everyday lives soar high.

I love Kiara for her never-ending energy and for changing myself as a person.

At first, I wasn't into hololive at all despite being vaguely aware of them due to the collab with AzurLane. Prior to the holoEN debut, I had just started seeing some hololive stuff show up on reddit. The Fubuki coverage of the baba oversleeping event was notable to me for how smart FBK was. However, It was a coincidence that I caught the holoEN debuts at all. I didn't watch Kiara initially during her debut. It was only after Calli strongly recommended her that I finally got around to it but she sold me on herself pretty much immediately with her confidence in languages. I thought she was basically the ideal person to bridge the EN and JP communities and I was very excited. However, it wasn't until the 4.5hr SC stream that I knew I absolutely wanted to support her no matter what and I had to join the KFP. After I discovered that German was her first language, my respect increased even more.


All of the scuffed streams at the start and her persistence throughout them really won me over. As someone who never wants kids, she still managed to awaken what I imagine is a paternal instinct. I don't want to call it pity because it's not like I wanted it to just magically all be better. I was rooting her on and seeing her mess up or self-sabotage sometimes really hurt. But I understand that I can't DO that much for her. But this is where KFP comes in. All of us want to see her happy and succeed and having the community helped me to sort out my feelings and how best to deal with the relationship between her as a streamer and us as the fans. I really do appreciate the conversations and ideas that are thrown around on Discord because even though I don't particularly care about having company, I haven't been this hyped in a long time about anything and it's nice to see others who feel the same way.

Kiara's desire to make others happy really made me reconsider how I should act and being able to see that effect on others in KFP really convinced me to give it a shot. I decided that I would just go 100% in on support (I will still point out things I don't like) whether or not I think she sees it or not because it's for her, and not for me. The level of excitement that you see from me in tweets or in Discord is starting to bleed out in real life where that is ABSOLUTELY not the case. The madwoman has me talking to myself at home, now. That said, the balance for supporting financially is something I still wonder about because it's kind of addictive, but I feel uncomfortable even though I can afford it. I spread the love around with YuYuAlpha because I know they're also an important part of Kiara's support.

And get off my lawn, you darn kids!


# Xenol

Honestly the reason I got into Kiara in the first place isn't as profound as most of you here. I started with HoloEN and watched all their debuts with a lot of cringe at first. Call me superficial but the initial reason I instantly developed a fondness for her is because I always liked fire Pokemon and she reminded me of them. The more I watch the more the reasons start to increase, her stream timings are convenient, I always root for the underdog and the tech issues she had in the beginning broke my heart to see her so sad, so I wanted to support her and root for her. As more time went by, I've decided "This is the one" and joined this fan discord, only to realize there is a really warm and wholesome community over here where we can be true to ourselves and support her.


# Zephyr Kitten

So in the past I've been a bit of a negative Nancy. It always felt easier to complain and whine than say nice things at times. I just have had a hard time wording compliments or positive words because I always have this voice in my head telling me "that doesn't sound genuine, that sounds awkward, don't post that." So a lot of the time I would chicken out and not post words of encouragement I really wanted to say, even if I had a burning desire to do so. And while it may seem hyperbolic to say "WOW MY ENTIRE LIFE CHANGED IN JUST TWO MONTHS AFTER WATCHING A VIRTUAL GIRL" I really do feel much more impassioned to say what I feel. I want to try and be more positive and make people feel good like I always wanted to. I want to post things that will warm people's hearts, even if that obnoxious voice in my head says "NO, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HATE THIS AND YOU'LL ONLY BE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF!" I'm sick of being a negative nancy, and I'm going to do everything I can to be a brighter person.


Kiara just works so goddamn hard to entertain her fans, and just the pure tenacity she has is just insane. That's what I love about her the most, just how genuine she is and how she makes me and her other fans feel like actual people and not just faces in a crowd. Even with tens of thousands of viewers I feel like she's speaking directly to me, and I hope it's the same for you guys too. She's your friend and my friend, and it's important to stick by your friends. Support her at her worst and tease her at her dorkiness. But most importantly, and this is so incredibly cheesy it practically hurts to type, KEEP BEING YOURSELF. Kiara is able to be herself because all of you guys do too. You're all cool, so keep kicking butt!


# ZThinker

So why do I love Kiara ? Man, what’s not to love about Kiara ?

I discovered Hololive in just August with Pekora and I fell down the hole after seeing all the girls. I wasn't a big fan of vtubers (not an anti, just that I didn't see the point of liking them) but I discovered that they are girls full of personalities, fun and especially humanity. They show their weaknesses at one point and I think we don't deserve those moments of humanity in an era where we keep trying to meme 'til there's only bones. That part of the internet kinda sucks. At that point, the 5th gen of Hololive appeared and the accident happened there and I felt sad but more focused about it.

A friend talked about the announcement of Hololive English and showed me the characters. I was like "holy shit, they're actually opening overseas ?". We talked a lot about the new characters like how Ina was made by one of the artists of Fate GO (I didn't care but I loved the design). And we talked about Kiara, the fact that she was drawn by huke, the man behind the art for Stein's;Gate and Black Rock Shooter. I was like "they fucking went money for this project". Because of this, I was waiting for the debuts. I saw some memes in reddit about the pre-debut tweets : Gura’s "a", the "it's small" from Amelia and the silly faces Kiara made. I was totally hyped.

And then came the day of the debuts. I loved them all. Calli made a huge impression on me and gave me so much trust.

Kiara also made one with her joyful attitude and her fangirling with Pekora. I mean, Pekora is an incredible vtuber so it's normal.

And she knew how to speak English, German, Japanese and bird. That's incredible, I only learnt two.

She loved Bakemonogatari. Fuck, she has some good taste.

And she sang well.

But to be honest, she wasn't my favorite at the start. I mean, I loved Calli because her rap was so good.

But I liked Kiara. I also liked Ina's chill, Gura's voice and how she makes me laugh and the weirdness of Ame when she was freaking coffee-intoxicated.

At that point, I had FIVE GIRLS to watch. That's a lot. I kinda chose to watch some stuff I loved, beginning with Calli's first stream and Kiara was the guest. It was a really good stream and after the first collaboration which was awkward, you could sense their friendship in that one. The teasing from Kiara in love with Calli was really funny and DAMN SHE RICKROLLED ME! FUCK THAT'S FUNNY MAN.

And I started to watch more of her streams. And more. And more. And I loved the bird to the point she got my SuperChat virginity on the 28th of September 2020. It was the first stream of Minecraft. Man she was so funny there. But the more I watched, the more she kept being open and showing herself. I was charmed by the light she kept showing, how nice she was and all.

It kept going. Maybe that's the whole thing I like from her. That bird brain, the jokes and roasts she has.

You may have seen a lot of jokes about bottom left and yes, she's lewd. Yes, she is ditzy at times. But man, you can't say she's fully stupid. She has that ability to make you learn life lessons. I keep remembering the time in a Fire Emblem stream about reaching people you don't like and how some talk can resolve everything. The most recent was that pep-talk about motivation and D-word and it sparked a light in the community. Man, she cried for a person who may have disappeared and instead of, just believing it's fake, she rolled with it and made an emotional word for it. It was the turning point where I was "Yeah, that's the one I simp for."

It's crazy that she fills her role as a Tenchou. She guides her community and makes it grow. I was kinda scared of joining the KFP discord server because I'm not good in large places. But seeing how you are, I was dumb. How couldn't I trust the guys and gals who followed Kiara ? I thought she showed the best of us and that's amazing.

You know what I love the most in her? Everything. Her whole personality, her content, her community. Fuck it. Everything. Thank you, Kiara, and thank you KFP. You kinda made me build confidence and move on from my bad relationship. I won't be as present as before but I'll try my hardest to represent this community with you.


# Asverd

I was already deep enough in the rabbit hole that I watched all the EN debuts as they happened, initially fearing cringe and then having my expectations completely subverted. I liked the five girls well enough, but I just found that Ina and Kiara's tastes were the closest to mine and, after a couple streams, Kiara had won me over completely. For me, it's the raw happiness and passion she shows every time, she's truly one of us chasing her dream. And as someone who has already chased his dream and found it pretty unsatisfying in the end, watching someone get the professional and emotional payoff that she deserves is kind of cathartic, I guess. I'm not good at relating to people or expressing my feelings, but fuck me if I don't want to support her all the way


# Ksetrel

It all started on the day of my birth, both of my parents failed to show up. Ok, enough joking around. (sorry, if there’s cringe)

I first started watching Hololive around a month before the debut of Gen 5. Started by watching Fubuki, then Coco, never having thought to watch the others. When Gen 5 debuted, I expanded a little and began to watch them, mostly Botan as she played a lot of FPS games. Still, I didn’t really put much thought into Hololive. I only watched them when I felt like it at that point in time. Then, the EN branch debuted. I subbed to all of them as I thought, “Hey, might as well support the new branch”. I watched all of the debuts live, even with the trouble of waking up early in the morning because of time zones. Due to the EN branch, I did keep on coming back to watch Hololive. I would watch Ame because FPS games, Gura not so much but the karaoke was fun, Calli ..well, she didn’t really stream much at first but it’s understandable. Ina- I really can’t because she streams super early for me. Then, there’s Kiara. I admit, she didn’t really attract me much at first. However, the more I watched her, the more my love for her grew. I want to support her as much as I can. Just watching her brings joy to me. Her personality keeps drawing me in. Then, I discovered pre-chat. God, the pre-chat was wholesome and fun. Seeing how everyone there was super friendly to one another and how they supported Kiara really sealed the deal for me. I realized that all of this happened due to one incredibly amazing and talented individual. Because of her just being her, she managed to create such an amazing community that really supports her and just wishes the best things for her. Don’t get me started on the way she interacts with her fans. She really loves her fans as much as her fans love her. I’m proud to be a part of KFP and I’m proud that we are one big happy cu—family.


# Tyroki

In the beginning, I wasn't exactly a stranger to VTubers. I didn't know what they were, but I was a fan of Kizuna Ai some years prior. Not her main channel, as that was really just idol stuff, but her gaming channel and the many entertaining clips held within.

After a year or two, I drifted away from her. It wasn't anything in particular enough to remember why. In the end, I think her material didn't really change and my interest ended up elsewhere. The vTuber scene wasn't really much more than her, and while she was an interesting concept in and of herself, I think that part of the problem could have been the language barrier. She was often fan-translated back then, but it could take days, and waiting for something just released wasn't particularly fun.

My life was quite up in the air, and I didn't know what was going on most of the time. I spent years no longer grounded in reality, just gaming and doing nothing else. For years, I couldn't use my voices. "Shut up", "you're too loud", "you're weird." It just made the world grey.

Over the following years, I did nothing but follow controversies left, right and center. I'd grown angry at the constant politics spewing across the internet, the endless Outrage Mob, the complete and utter idiocy that people consistently spouted regardless of what political camp they existed in, and regardless of what country they lived in. I grew to be quite toxic, watching toxic communities on all sides spread misinformation and try to one up each other. That's toxic by my own standards, mind you. Not someone else's.

I continued watching videos, reading articles, viewing streams of various governments and their popcorn worth shenanigans. The House of Commons in the UK was a particular favourite. I grew ever more frustrated at the steaming pile of shit that was the world. Yes, I watched people like Hero Hei from time to time, knowing full well the kind of person he was, because I didn't really care what effect he had on anything he covered. A lot of what I watched were thanks to the Youtube algorithm ever pushing content after you've watched someone once. "Oh, you watched this person once? You want me to fill your suggested videos with them, right?"

My first introduction to Hololive was through Gigguk, though I didn't really pay much attention. People only speaking in Japanese? I don't understand Japanese, and have long struggled to learn, so that wasn't exactly interesting without translations. Of course I didn't know about LiveTLs back then, though LiveTLs aren't exactly consistently available. Gigguk focused on Coco, but she sounded loud and obnoxious at the time. She is, but I was very wrong about her personality and how awesome she is. But overall, I was put off.

It wasn't until Youtube decided to show me yet another Hero Hei video after I'd long cast him off as the misinforming vulture he is that Youtube decided to show me another of his videos. Normally by that point I'd just ignore it, too lazy to tell youtube to stop showing me his videos. He hadn't popped up in weeks or more. But something about it was interesting. "Gura Fans are Lolicons". He was covering that chick who was trying to spread hate toward Gura for being like a kid, a chick who definitely wasn't a fan, and very much didn't seem to be trying to drum up interest in Gura through controversy.

So I finally decided to look into whatever this Hololive nonsense was. I couldn't see what the chick was on about, but that first taste of Gura's entertaining personality through clips and then the archives drew me in. At first I only flicked through her archives like the pages of a book I wasn't quite interested in, but soon I would be watching her content consistently, and very much enjoyed it.

Soon I was discovering the other girls in The Myth through the Collab VODs. Kiara was the most off putting to me at first. Her early behaviour, that stubborn attitude, being unwilling to ever admit defeat despite it being obvious she'd lost, amongst other personality traits just seemed endlessly obnoxious to me. At least, initially.

Yet the more I was subjected to her through the collabs, the more I came to enjoy her content, and the more I appreciate her work and the way she did things. Then came the appreciation of her personality. The more I learned about her, the more I came to see how kind, caring and considerate she could be (and very much was back then). I began to comment on her vids, actually managed to catch her live because she was on later when no one else I could understand was on, and started getting very involved with her pre-chat community.

The more I watched, the more I chatted, the more I came to enjoy the community. I began to explore more of the Usagi Hole, coming to enjoy this mess of an industry and it's wacky, and wonderful, glory.

A week or two in, despite financial troubles, I borrowed the $6 needed to become a member, working the expense into my already low budget after medical expenses. I live in New Zealand, so those are off-set somewhat by our social systems, but it's still rough when you don't have much money to begin with.

I spent my time trying to come up with memes for pre-chat to make use of, or to modify/streamline existing memes. Bok bok chu, water check at 10 minutes, flush at 5 minutes (though pre-chat started early sometimes). People helped me out, simping for me as Kiara would call it, throwing my suggestions and other fun comments into Super Chats for me. I wanted to be more involved. It was all so much fun, and I was really starting to feel like colour was returning to my life. I started messing with my voices again, regardless of what anyone around me said, which just applied jet boosters to the fun I was having.

Then came the day when I was told how to set filters for Live Chat, allowing me to catch LiveTLs much more easily. I decided that as a test, I would take the ever-loving piss. I began to use the [EN] tag to have some fun during pre-chat for the Kiara x Rushia collab. I made Rushia out to be some kind of bird in the distance. I moved on to taking the piss out of Kiara in the same way, all in good fun of course. Naturally she showed up in the middle of it, and fired Judas... again. I made her out to be some sort of large bird-like predator, out hunting lowly prey. I was jokingly asked to make it an actual documentary, though at the time I had zero knowledge of making videos, and couldn't draw worth a damn. I needed sounds, and was directed to the discord. Fancords often keep a collection of recordings from their streamer, and it was a wealth of sounds.

No one believed that I would actually show up, until I did. I took the documentary idea very seriously, but while I tried numerous times to put it together, I had a lot of issues with my microphone setup. I got into debt, improved my kid dramatically so that it could handle my voices, and here we are. Ready to finally get things done after all this time.

A lot of things have happened since. I can't really watch Kiara live anymore due to timezones. New Zealand and Australia are Oceania. For me, it's JP+3 (or +4 for our DST). That puts streams squarely in the 2am+ mark. Kiara used to alternate timezones, but now she doesn't and it's too hard to keep up now. But I do try to catch her in collabs.


# Reto

Before Hololive, I knew next to nothing about Discord, but after becoming so invested in these people who I somehow connected with so strongly, I wanted to connect with others with whom I could share my interest and fascination. I was an active member of the Botan fan discord, during which they made a Minecraft server for the community to play on. It was also during this time that they announced a Minecraft building contest for Botan's birthday coming up. I knew that this was something I could take part in as well as a way that I might be able to show my appreciation for Botan and Hololive as a whole. But what to make?

I resolved to make a statue of Botan and it was going to be the most extra statue I could make. But as much as I tried different designs, nothing felt right. This is when I decided to make a Minecraft skin of Botan and to use that as my reference for the build: a simple 1:2 statue.

Long story short, I won the contest and had a cute skin to use as a result, but little did I know that soon enough Hololive was about to get bigger

HololiveEN

Admittedly, I was skeptical. I'd seen many girls on YouTube do the "cute anime voice" thing and it never rubbed me the right way. I was worried that HoloEN would be cringe of the highest calibre, but I kept my mind open and marathoned every debut.

Interestingly enough, I was drawn to Kiara ever since she started posting on Twitter. Something about her felt different and her design struck me in a way I couldn't let go of. I was pleasantly surprised to see that every member surpassed my expectations, even blew them out of the water, but Takanashi Kiara was something else. She felt so genuine and so kind that I knew this was the one. I eagerly joined the KFP fan discord server after anxiously waiting for it to appear in the #related_links channel in Botan's server.

Of course my admiration for Kiara only grew as I watched her more and I saw that she was such a pleasant person to listen to and engage with, not to mention the way she seems to care so much for those who watch her. It's something I'd never seen before and something I wasn't particularly used to, given that my experiences with Hololive up until now had been very one-sided. It very honestly felt like she cared as much as we did

To top it off, I knew that as the days tarried on, they were going to eventually play Minecraft. I'd only made one skin before, but admittedly I was proud of it. I felt like I finally had something that I could use to show Kiara, HoloEN, and all of Hololive how much I cared for and supported them. I'd never considered myself creative or artistic, so the idea that I could finally give back was exhilarating. I resolved that I would make Kiara a Minecraft skin, though I feel I have to mention that I resolved to do so with no expectation for her to use it or to even reply to me. I fully intended for her to see it, give it a like, and know that someone cared enough to make something for her, like all other fanart. That would've been enough for me.

Imagine my surprise when she saw it and wanted to use it! Imagine how it must've felt to watch a stream where a huge YouTuber was using something you made! Imagine how it must've felt for thousands to see your creation on the big screen! Imagine how it must've felt for dozens of people on the discord server to say such nice things about you! Imagine how it must've felt for one moment in your life that you felt like somebody. That something you did mattered.

It really was just a Minecraft skin, but feeling that appreciation and all that encouragement really got to me. I truly had never felt that before. I bawled like a baby for at least a half-hour, watching her stream through bleary eyes. I never intended to keep going, but everyone kept on saying, "Reto. You're going to finish the job right? Of course you are." I didn't wanna disappoint, and I seriously didn't expect any other HoloEN member to want to use my skins, but I tried anyway. It was the least I could do in appreciation for the community, friends, and meaning Hololive gave me.

Through all this, I realized that I have talents that I never knew I had before. It's made me rethink what I am capable of. I always thought when I graduated college the only thing I could do is work a boring job working with numbers because that's all I've ever been good at. Hololive helped me realize that I do have a creative side and it's been dying to be let free for years. I want to draw, I want to write, I want to sing, I want to do so many things that I never would've had the guts to pursue if it weren't for these pngs I found on YouTube one day. I'd found something special.


These days I find myself meeting and discovering new vtubers everyday. Many of them have requested skins for me and many have been generous enough to show me that my work has value and donated money as compensation for my efforts. And many of them I just like to hang out with, including Kiara, of course. I've never been social or especially inclined to want to reach out to others, but now I can't get enough of it. I want to connect with everyone. I want to meet everyone. I want to share my talents with others and spread as many smiles and good vibes as I can. That's really been the goal the whole time and I'll be darned if I let that go.


# Weremore 02

don't mind me, I'll just talk about how I got in here

ok so, Tbh I don't remember when I exactly knew about hololive, but there was Kizuna Ai. I think after I watched a few vids of her with Joey, I think I came across the video where the girls were jumpscared. Fast forward a few months later, and I came across the perfect guide to hololive video. But the one who got me into the hole was Suisei, because her tetris skills were amazing. I decided to search up more about her and from there, that's how I fell in the hole.

When Holomyth was announced, Kiara caught my eye because of her belt. I was hoping to get a Kamen Rider version of one of the girls. I was a bit disappointed when she didn't transform in her debut, but it was still fun nonetheless.

I missed a few streams because of my lessons, but hey, the archives were there lol.

And fast forward a few months later, and I'm here I guess. that's all.


After 2 or 3 days the girls had their first big Minecraft collab and in my state of boredom and wanting to stop being sad about my whole ordeal, I decided to tune in to watch. Started watching Calli, and I noticed her interactions with Kiara being the best out of the bunch. I started watching the girls’ streams again slowly but surely, and started enjoying their content with an oddly greater appreciation than before.

Onto Kiara specifically: there was a poll that some Vtuber clipper put up on YouTube asking: Who of the Hololive EN girls would you want to be best friends with? I took that question to heart and thought long about it. I first chose Amelia because I have a good friend who is very much like her, but something didn’t feel right. I then shortly changed my vote over to Kiara after thinking a bit longer, realizing “Hey, she’s actually a really cool girl, and everyone needs that goofball of a best friend.” From there I started watching Kiara content with a bit more enthusiasm.

Eventually, I was tired of only having 1-3 emotes only for Kiara by being in the HOLOLIVE RESISTANCE server, so I followed the link to join the Kiara Discord server. I don’t know exactly what happened but I just remember the chat being super welcoming and wholesome, so I was super happy and wholesome in return, which led to my first ban for being too wholesome. Ahhh the memories.

Anyways. The longer I stayed in this server, the more I was slowly indoctrinated into following our queen of Fried Chicken, Frau Kiara. I have since let most of my walls down, but try to keep some semblance of decency because all of you are too dang wholesome, and I can’t help but be wholesome to you guys. This server has literally helped change my life into a much more positive setting than before, and has been so much of a blessing that even with all the nonsense that has been happening to me in 2020, I will remember this community and the HoloEN girls the most, because of how much y’all changed things around for me.

Also shoutout to the Trash Taste Podcast because they threw me into this Pekora hole.


# Inkless

I got into Hololive a few months back, shortly before Gen 5 debuted. My friend sent me some funny videos about a fox and a dog, and a rabbit hurling a rare item into lava. I was charmed by the cute characters and sought out more on my own, but the more I got into it the more I realized how human the connection really was between the members of Hololive and their communities. It wasn't like most streamers, keeping people at arm's length. It was like using the avatar to let them take off their other masks and be their genuine self in front of a crowd. And honestly, it was some of the most wholesome content I had ever seen in my life. I watched the Gen 5 premier and got hooked properly, seeing for myself where so many of the others had gotten their start, the transition from those first floundering steps to establishing their brands and styles. I branched out into older generations, stuck my head in here and there, and found more and more to love about the brand, the community and the performers. The thing that crystallized it for me, that made me want to pay for the entertainment I was receiving, was Kiara. I have a thing for underdogs, and redheads, but more importantly I have a thing for people with hearts too big for their chests. I see Kiara streaming, worrying over how well she's doing, whether people like her, whether she's good enough for the support she receives, and my own heart aches a bit, knowing that she's all that we say she is and more. One of my friends tried to intentionally spoil my fun by doxxing her, throwing whatever he could find my way to "shatter the illusion", but at the end of the day all it did was reinforce my support for where she's at now. It was the humanity in Hololive that made me want to watch it, not the "illusion", and seeing more of that humanity in the pasts and stories of the performers only makes me smile harder when they talk about how happy they are to be living the life they have. And that's my story.

I guess the first time I saw Kiara and instantly wanted to support her was when two of my friends were competing on who simps harder on Gura. I never knew HololiveEN was a thing yet, and only watched HoloJP clips from time to time.

Watching one of Gura's streams was actually pretty fun. I didn't know that I would be watching a Vtuber for 2 hours in my life, and only then did I realize she was from Hololive. I didn't know there already were idols who spoke English, so I checked the other members (this was when I fell down the rabbit hole permanently lmao).

I subscribed to everyone in HoloEN immediately and watched their debut. But Kiara really caught my eye on this one. The reason wasn't really the fact that the Phoenix is my favorite mythical creature, but she just seemed to pop off in my perspective from the five.

All of them, including JP, CN, ID, and HoloStars are great too, don't get me wrong, but Kiara's  stream vibes were just my taste. She's fun to listen to, very chaotic, wholesome, and translates for the JP audience (that's some talent). I even remember the stream where she got criticized for self translating herself for the JP Bros, but I think that's bull. For that, Kiara inspired me to relearn Japanese again, and here I am, mastered Hiragana and Katakana in a month, and starting to learn basic Kanji.

Her streams were really at convenient times for me, maybe because JP time is just 1 hour ahead of my time. There I got to experience the feeling of wanting to support an idol, for the very first time. She exerts effort for everyone like how that one McDonalds employee gives 2-3 nuggets in their boxes, it was crazy. Her extrovertedness even affected my personality a bit to the point where I talk my mind more than usual.

This point in my life was probably one of the lowest this year. Because of stressful school tasks and serious medical attention (in a better place now), I haven't been really doing things passionately like I used to. But for some reason, I still go to Kiara. Even if I'm tired, I go to her streams and just laugh with her. It's like seeing your bed once again after traveling 12 hours in a bus. I guess you can say watching her was a recreational activity for me.

After all those pain-in-the-back events, I'm still here, excitedly waiting for her Single and HoloTALK events this upcoming week. If Kiara does read these in the future, thank you for being so... you! You can say you saved my life here, it hasn't been this bright in some months. -KazeMir

Throughout my life, I never found myself interested in people I’ve never met. I saw how people were really invested in celebrities, idols, seiyus, and streamers, but I never understood them. I’d think the people were cool and interesting, but that’s about it. I was never interested in really supporting anyone and seeing their journey unfold. Going into vtubers back in July I expected it to be the same thing where I would just appreciate the stuff they do, and that’s as far as my emotional investment would go. At first it was like this. I went between Suzuhara Lulu, Kiryu Coco, Haachama, and when Gen 5 came, I got interested in Polka. When EN came around though things changed.

I spent the first week watching everyone’s streams live to see what they were like. I did mess up my sleeping schedule because of it, but it was definitely worth it. Watching the EN streams was fun since I could understand everything without needing chat TLs or clips for once. As time went on, I found myself really invested in Kiara. You could tell that she wore her heart on her sleeve, and it made it really fun to watch her. Her happiness and frustration were infectious, and I’d find myself cheering and shouting along with her at times. It was the most enjoyment I felt out of seeing someone doing something they enjoyed. I found myself at the edge of my seat wanting to see what was next, and she really delivered.


Her streams had their ups and downs, and there were moments where she opened up to us about what was troubling her. Even if she thought she might be saying too much, I really appreciated that she felt she could talk with us about what she was going through. It was nice that we could make a safe space for her, and even though she was streaming for us, I was glad we could give back in the form of emotional support. Seeing her sad from that SC about her live TLs, her feeling insecure about her place and talent made me want to support her with everything I had. Even more so with all of her technical issues at the beginning. She was able to fix them eventually, but it really stressed her out as it was going on. The FE stream she privated was a good example of the issues she faced, while also showing how tenacious she is. She’s a really hardworking emotional bird, who has high standards for herself, and she’s really someone to look up to. I knew this bird would go places and I wanted to see where she’d take us. I decided early on that she would be the first person I’d get a membership for, and that she’d be my first SC. I’ve loved seeing her grow these past 2 months now, and she’s brought a lot of happiness to my life. This isn’t even getting started on the community she fostered.


Being part of the KFP server is one of the things I’m most grateful for this year. I’ve never been part of an online community, but I feel so at home here at KFP. There are names I remember from being here everyday, and I love seeing everyone fool around while also supporting our Tenchou and each other. It’s seriously a family, and I feel like I belong. Everyone’s encouraging each other making clips, art, Minecraft skins etc. It’s a really supportive place to be, and I’m happy people are pursuing things that give themselves happiness, and also giving it to those around them. Someone was even kind enough to gift me their extra copy of Minecraft, and the KFP Minecraft server became my first time playing with other people. It was so much fun being with my fellow employees. Seeing the stuff they’d make, and doing my part to help them make what they wanted was really fulfilling. Also got to chat with people more individually that way. I remember being welcomed into the starting settlement by General Pekorin, and I remember when Tum gave me my first diamond pick while I worked on the Book Hall in Vogel. It was just a pick, but I felt really touched by it. People inviting me to join them in the villages they were starting made me feel so welcomed. It’s been a great place to be, and whenever I find myself being stressed, I can definitely just hop into the discord server to calm my nerves.


VIVA LA KIARA! VIVA LA KFP!!

I believe, like a lot of my fellow employees, I was led towards the rabbit hole by clips of cute girls doing funny things. Around two months before HoloEN debuted, I wasn’t watching any Vtubers and only knew them through said clips. I heard news of the HoloEN debuts,  got interested and finally decided to watch the debuts and give this whole thing a go... after all what could possibly happen, right? One particular member caught my attention immediately. The reason might sound a little dumb, but it was Kiara and her first language being german, my mothertongue. I decided to subscribe to her and then proceeded to forget about vtubers for a while as I got busy IRL.

A few days later, I saw the [Karaoke Party] livestream and even though the sound quality wasn't the best and some hiccups happened, her voice and personality was endearing enough to make me continue watching. I decided to watch more Vtubers and caught streams here and there of different EN members until I found my favorite in Kiara. That opinion was only solidified further as I saw her in collabs with the EN girls, her dynamic in groups and finally her wholesome, funny, lewd and sometimes yabai superchat readings. She made me fall completely. I couldn‘t stop watching her streams as Kiara overcame her early setbacks and self doubts. I took joy in seeing her grow and shine brighter, and decided to join her membership and the KFP discord.

 

Today I can‘t imagine how different things could have been, had I never watched, or decided to not give her a chance for technical difficulties or other reasons. I believe I would have regretted not knowing her or the KFP family. At this point I enjoy everything she does, for who she is and find joy in participating in events organised by the KFP family for celebrations, be it drawing, singing and talking. I didn't know I could enjoy this much. Probably a simple way to end up at this point, so let me end this simply for my Oshi  too.

Viva la Kiara

When I fell into the rabbit hole of Hololive, it was hard to find a community to share all of my artwork. Especially with the styles that I make, pixel art and 8bit, a.k.a. retro style. So whenever I made a pixel art, I shared it with my friends that brought me to the Hololive experience.

Then one day, my friend told me that there will be a new group called Hololive English. I watched all the debut streams and eventually fell into HoloEN. One day while we were speaking,  my friend asked "Hey! Why not share your pixel art and your 8-bit covers of hololive related things on twitter?"At the time, I didn’t think that anyone other than our small friend group would enjoy it as it wasn’t “cool”, but  he was like, "Just try it." And so I posted my 8bit covers of all HoloEN's Loading Screen BGM on twitter with my pixel art on it.

 Fast forward to the first HoloEN Minecraft collab, after the GREAT TUNNELING stream, I decided to make a minecraft 3d art of it. It caught the attention of Kiara, who asked  "That is so cool, how do you do these things? They look so cinematic lmao ''. I replied that I used a program called Mine-imator, which really did everything I needed it to. Someone else commented that they used to watch 3D minecraft animations back in the day, and that gave me the idea to learn how to do that. Lo and behold, The “Kiara's Roommate” Animation was made, and I unlocked a new achievement/skill to make 3d animations.

After releasing the Roommate Animation, someone commented that he was trying to reach out to me about a project that he was working on. So I contacted him and was told that he had seen my Kiara Loading BGM 8bit and he wanted me to join his project. I asked him for further details, decided to join, and here I am: An art director of Besto Friend Team for our upcoming game called Idol Showdown: A Hololive 2d Retro Fighting Fan Game.

Without Kiara and HoloEN in general, maybe I would still be stuck in that phase of being too shy to share everything and wouldn’t have been discovered by the game developer of Idol Showdown. So Thank you Kiara and to all HoloEN.

So my first contact with Hololive was the Azur Lane collab actually, although I don't remember what I thought about it at the time. Later, I found Lyger’s channel and started watching some Matsuri clips from there as well as a few other clippers as well and eventually got to know a lot of the members. But the only actual streams that I watched were Haachama relaxing minecraft ones, for example the one that she built the church for her wedding with Watame, cause she actually spoke a bit of english sometimes. My favorites before HoloEN would be Pekora, Marine, Hachama, Ayame and Watame.

When the auditions for holoEN were announced, I thought “well good luck with that”, the magic of the vtubers is that they kept out of politics and are just there to entertain. The western side of the internet couldn't possibly do it. And then they were revealed, by design I was liking Ina and Gura, the others weren’t as eye-catching I would say. So I would give it a shot without expectations and see what happens.

So Kiara, the first thing that caught my attention was the ease that she switched between japanese and english, then her excitement when Huke spoke in the chat, and then she mentioned that her favorite was Pekora. Well you had my curiosity, but now you have my attention. What a fangirl we have here. One of us! Also the anime and JRPGs  that she enjoys overlap a bit with mine so that helped.

There wasn't an exact stream that set her as my favorite, it's just all of it together i would say, her karaoke high notes, her endless supply of energy, her interaction with the fans, she’s just an all around very fun and good human being that i can't help but want to keep cheering on. And just like that, I haven't missed a stream, and I'm always eager for more.

Her ability to make such an engaging and fun stream  that nothing else matters at that moment is so important to me because I'm an overthinker so it really helps being able to keep my mind offline. And even more important,she’s so genuine, yes she’s playing a character  but she doesn't shy away from being real with us and letting some of her real feelings through.

So much more I could write here but this is getting long.

So yes, I’m a Kiara simp and I'm proud of it.I want to see this girl fulfil her dream.

Now about you guys here at KFP, it's very nice seeing everyone getting along nicely, and I hope it continues like this for a very long while. It's so wholesome to see a group that just like me wants to see this beautiful Phoenix succeed in her endeavours.

I do not talk much but I do appreciate you guys.

VIVA LA KIARA!


# Poem2self

My journey started with having my brother, who I have a close relationship with, watching Hololive around April 2020. I had been aware of the existence of vtubers since Kizuna ai was a thing, but brushed it off as a stupid silly meme. He'd show me clips (like Haachama singing Shape of You) or annoying fans constantly requesting Jojo songs in karaoke but I never really looked into it myself.

Fast forward to August 13th, 2020. Me and my brother were up in the middle of the night and he's watching Minato Aqua play Ocarina of Time, so I decided to tune in myself. And what I saw, was not only quite possibly the worst Zelda gameplay I have ever seen but also the funniest content ever in a way. It's hard to describe but it hit all the marks for me in terms of comedic value; cute girls doing things and making a fool of themselves.

So I'm sitting here, wondering "Why am I enjoying this? Why is this so cute and funny to me? I love this!" and I was immediately hooked. It was crazy to me, because I used to hate streaming and streaming culture but this was a whole new thing to me. The very next day, I sent my first superchat ever to Aqua, telling her that her American fans loved her, because I sure as hell did.

At this point I was only into Aqua and Watame, but my brother told me about the auditions for Hololive EN and how they would be debuting in less than a month. Unfortunately the only ones I could catch live were parts of Gura's and Watson's but I ended up watching the VOD of Calliope's debut. And I remember saying "Yep, Calliope is definitely going to be my favourite."

I was proven wrong.

I was able to catch Kiara Takanashi playing Fall Guys live, and was also very interested, however it never really struck me until later what interested me in her.

It was the very next day, I think, a collab between Mori and Kiara. And Kiara just had this energy to her, that couldn't be replicated.(edited)

Her personality and model were bouncy, she was hilarious, incredibly sweet, and her design was gorgeous and even moreso unique! I simply couldn't get enough of those two hats she wore and her colour scheme. She simply had it all, just like Aqua. This combined with her synergy with Mori immediately made her my favourite of all in Hololive.

The great thing is, the bottom left energy isn't her only side. She's extremely friendly and just knows how to lighten a room and spark things in others, with or without being a cute klutz. She can be super down to Earth too, something which I don't see talked about as much.

I've superchatted Aqua once, Mori once, however since then,  I've only superchatted to Kiara since then and multiple times. I joined her membership on the day it came out, played Mario Kart with her on stream, and tuned into countless streams especially the Fire Emblem ones as it is my favourite video game series.

Her cover of A Cruel Angel's Thesis made me watch Neon Genesis Evangelion (yes, really)

I've even connected with a friend through Kiara. This guy who was in a mutual server with me who we only bonded over Fire Emblem with a few times, had sent a superchat. "[Friend] Dankeschön!" Kiara joyfully said. I went straight to discord and asked if it was him, sure enough, Kiara is one of his favourites too.

I could go on for hours about the positive influence Hololive and Kiara have positively impacted my life, but I think I've made my point clear. I've forged friendships, listened to amazing karaoke and have had tons of laughs with friends and family thanks to vtubers and I couldn't be more happy with them. Viva La Kiara!



# Arty

Initially, I fell down the rabbit hole around April with the Fukkireta video featuring all the girls at the time, with Roboco being my first subscription way back in late 2018 before I even knew what Hololive was!

Surprisingly, when I saw the announcement for HoloMyth being an EN branch, I was a little apprehensive at the thought because I thought that it wouldn't be as appealing as the JP talents or that the fanbase for them would be more toxic than that of the prior girls. To be quite honest, I wasn't very interested in Kiara because when I first saw her all I could think of was a E-Girl putting on a fake personality with a voice that was kind of grating against my ears (please forgive me Tenchou), so I kind of skipped her content during the first week, but still subbed because I thought why not. After the first week or so, I wanted to give Kiara another chance and that is when she started growing on me quickly.

I was kicking myself for not giving her much of a chance early on and decided to full on commit to watching all her streams when I am available so I could learn more about her. Discovering that she could speak three different languages was a surprise, her very endearing and genuine personality being able to make us both laugh and our hearts scrunch up whenever it gets a little too real makes her super relatable in the stories that she's told us, and how she just rolls with the chat now with her spot on the chart being chained to the bottom left forever.

TAKAMORI also played a large part in the appeal of Kiara for me as well since I simped our boy, the Reaper apprentice, Calliope Mori as my first membership before I decided on Kiara. The way Kiara and Calli interact provide my brain with a copious amount of serotonin and fill my cold dead heart with the warm fuzzies. Maybe I need to be bonked for all the TAKAMORI content I retweet, but it feels very genuine to me that they can generate such a rapport and real feeling interactions. Kiara has proven to us already that she really cares for others and it is only reinforced since she organized a day for Calli to unwind and relax since she was such a hard-working reaper who could’ve worked herself to death if not for an intervention from Kiara.


Thank you, Kiara, for all the work that you have done so far to build such a wonderful community in the KFP crew. It would have been a lot harder to pass the year without you, Holomyth and Hololive as a whole.


As always, VIVA LA KIARA~



# DogBoyStone

I fell into the rabbit hole of hololive by coming across Minato Aqua on Instagram, I saw a post of her,  thought she was cute and followed the hashtag. I continuously saw posts with that hashtag but with different girls. After I did some research and found out about hololive, I saw some videos but the first stream I really saw was a Coco singing one. I didn’t watch a lot of hololive at the time about 2 months ago. Then some days after the news about Holo-En came out, I discovered it existed. I didn't watch the debuts and I really regretted it after I saw all the holoen girls. They were really cute but the one that got me was Takanashi Kiara: a super cute, goofy, funny, amazing, sweet, entertaining character. I liked and still like everything about Kiara; her knowledge about multiple languages was something that I liked a lot because it was something I had in common with her. I liked her stupendous design, her personality, the way she acts and how she treats so kindly people, but I also like her voice. That super cute voice where a lot of super kind and meant from the heart words come from. Kiara is the hololive member I watch the most and she'll always have a place in my heart. Viva La Kiara o7 my fellow KFP colleagues

Simpjénkins KFP's Snack Cashier

So how did I find Kiara and KFP you ask ? Well it’s a short but i think it's a good little story so sit back and enjoy.

The first time I saw a Hololive Member was a (i think Fan made) Video from Fubuki where she plays the Kirby song  with all the different cuts and all. I laughed so hard at it that I think I watched it four times in a row. So after that Video a Friend of mine sent me the link to the video that Gigguk made and I watched it. Then he announced the HoloEN Debuts streams, which surprised me since I didn’t even know that EN was coming. But because of the Fubuki Video and Gigguk, YouTube thought that maybe I would be interested in the Gura Debut stream. And yeah, I liked it so much that for my first week, I watched Gura and the other girls Debuts streams. But when I got to Kiara’s Debut stream, it was a kinda different feeling. I felt an instant sympathy for her. I liked the way she talked, what she had for hobbies and what her goals were at the moment. And yes this sounds a little bit stupid but I saw that she had the lowest sub count from all of the Girls and I said to myself "I want to support this Underdog."  So I subscribed, watched a few Videos, and lurked in the Pre-Chat. When the Singing collab with Nene got announced, I was hyped cause I got to hear her for the first time Singing live. And as I heard her Singing Voice, I  was like "Dang I'm kind of feeling I’m falling down a hole....."


 So yeah this is pretty much all of the story. Nothing special or something, just a Man who's enjoying the Voice of a Phoenix  and the Chaos she brings sometimes.



# WildNexus

Discovering Vtubers has been a bit of a journey for me. I first saw a Kizuna Ai video a few years ago but didn’t think much of it and moved on. A couple years later I saw a few more videos with vtubers (I don’t remember the names) but again moved on. It was not until this year that I really started paying attention. I discovered a few Western indie vtubers and that started me down the path. What officially brought me into the Hololive world was Korone and her Doom clips. Because of Doog I eventually found Coco and her meme reviews.  Even with my growing interest, I never engaged with the talents or the community. Some of it was due to the language barrier, but another reason was that no one around me was (and still isn’t) into vtubers.

While I knew a little bit about the 5th gen, I really began to focus on Hololive once I heard about the debut of Hololive EN. I was working during the debut streams but I went back and watched all of them. Calli completely caught me with her amazing raps and general awkwardness, Ina with her drawings and  calmness, Gura with her cuteness, singing, and the meme, Ame with her weird concoction and gremlin vibe, and last was Kiara. Kiara did pique my interest a little due to her being able to speak multiple languages, her infectious Pekora-inspired laugh, and Steins:Gate design (seriously though why does she have sleeves?). Kiara is now my favorite vtuber, but if I’m honest, she didn’t really catch me in the same way the others did; at least initially.

I did watch her streams, but I was more of a passive viewer. I’d open the stream as something to play in the background during work. I enjoyed the karaoke stream and FallGuys stream, but what turned me around was her first SC reading stream. Seeing how she interacted with her fans and how much of an open person she was/is pulled me in. Even when she was at a low point, it was so genuine that it really resonated with me. I understand that feeling and still struggle with those same doubts. But seeing Kiara still push forward and how her fans returned the support 1000x over was/is amazing. Not out of pity, but out of love and wanting this phoenix to succeed. I felt that, for the first time in a long time, I wanted to openly and actively support a creator. I started to participate in prechat a bit more and engage with the community a little more. Everyone’s welcoming and kind attitudes were really reflective of the kind of place Kiara wanted to make. Watching Kiara stumble, get back up, grow, and succeed thus far has been an experience I have never had in an internet community before. She has earned the adoration of her fans and rightly deserves all the love and support. I’m so proud of how far she’s come and how far she can still go.

One last thing. I know it's sappy but she has inspired me to keep pushing and try things I would have been too shy or not confident to do before. To keep pushing and do things I’m proud of regardless of how others see it. Even if I fail and stumble, I know I can rise up just like our lovely Phoenix.


# Deemo Harlos

The Rabbit Hole - My journey to KFP

Hi everyone, I’m Deemo Harlos, a KFP pianist. I want to share my story of how I started to follow HoloLive EN and eventually become deeply connected with KFP.

I first heard about vTubers in the beginning of the year. It did not attract my attention much, since I am neither a fan of game streaming, nor do I understand Japanese well. It was not until a week or two ago when my Facebook was filled with posts about Hololive EN and so that I noticed them. The first thing really caught my eye while searching for more details is Calliope’s Rap “失礼しますが、RIP♡”, which really amazed me with the fluent mix of two languages and the fact that how talented vTubers can be.

And that’s when I slipped into the rabbit hole. Soon later I found myself scrolling through YouTube everyday looking for vTuber clips, especially those of Hololive EN, which are in a language I am familiar with. At first I claimed not to be a DD too soon, but soon after I decided to subscribe to all the five members: Kiara, Calliope, Ina, Gura and Watson.

Let’s make things clear: I do not like them just because they are cute anime girls or something. Each of them had some characteristics that attracted me a lot. In some streams they each told some story about how they became what they are now, and also some life perspectives and lessons. To me, they are not just moving characters on the screen. There are souls in them that give me positive energy. I also respect them for their effort to become what they are to give happiness and love to everyone, and so I look to them.

Soon my daily routine became more chaotic than it was. Many nights I do not sleep at all, just to watch their streams. I can’t help but think Hololive EN just gave me too much happiness I wasn't able to get before.

Kiara Fried Phoenix

At one of Kiara’s streams someone said that there are servers for each member. As a Discord “experienced” user I quickly joined in every one of them. KFP is the most active of all, and I hopped into the voice chat filled with people. It has already been a couple of years since I moved my life focus from reality to the Internet, but getting into a foreign based server is completely a different experience, with a new group of people that have never known anything about myself.

Everyone that I have met in KFP is very friendly and kind to me, which was way more than I had expected. I managed to play piano in the voice chat, and I am very happy to receive many compliments and encouragement, which I did not actually get much before. Also we get to listen to other musicians in KFP, and listening to their performances is a wonderful experience. We also chatted about stuff, helped out someone with relationship problems, and even watched a movie together. In merely four days I have been through so much fun with the new friends. I never wanted to leave the voice chat, and therefore my daily routine has become even MORE chaotic.

Some of my story

I first learned keyboard and basic music theory when I was 7. But after four years or so I stopped learning. It was 15 when I started on the piano, self-taught. And the biggest motivation was this game, Deemo, a wonderful rhythm game. I really liked the music from Deemo, so I looked for free music sheets and tried to practice on my own. In my high school times I joined a wind band as a new learner in percussion, and as my interest in music gradually grew I learned many music theories and composing/arranging techniques.

At university I started to listen to many amazing music YouTubers such as SLSMusic, Animenz, phyxinon, and so on. Gradually the thought of playing piano through the Internet and influencing people with music became one of my life goals.


The truth is that I am neither a confident nor a positive person. I only consider my piano playing decent. Decent yet not enough to stand out from the crowd. I make many mistakes and lack improvising techniques, compared with the music YouTuber I look up to. I know I need time to practice, but thanks to the mental issues and the schoolwork I can barely squeeze time out. I have hard times living my life and spending most of the day dealing with my own emotions. I did see a doctor and take medicine, though I still have to go through the self-hating phasis every day. This feeling gets even worse whenever I see other people shining in their own career, field or talent, especially music, like those in KFP. Many people told me that I do not have to hurry, and that I can walk at my own pace. So many people and things that always remind me that I am walking slower than any other people, and I just can’t get away with it and tell myself it is okay that I do nothing to improve now.

Somebody mentioned something like Holofried or Hololive EN Gen 2. I, of course, clearly knew that I do not have a cute looking or voice. Though that thought of becoming a vTuber indeed went through my mind for a second. But no way. I do not have that kind of personality. Plus, my English speaking kind of sucks. Nevertheless, to some extent I do want to excel myself to the same level as Kiara, all the other Hololive EN members, the music youTubers, and such. I really want to improve myself so that someday I could be at the same level as theirs, and collaborate or cooperate with them in terms of my talents and skills.

Thanks

To Kiara

I know you might not read this, since this is not a superchat anyways. I’ve watched many VODs and clips of yours, so I know many moments that you give inspirational speeches, share life perspectives and talk about your internal feelings. I love how genuine and sincere you are, just like a close friend. Whenever I listen to you talking about how you fight hard to become what you are and that the hard work has finally paid off, I always feel happy for you and want to cry with you. I’ve always wanted to be someone like you, who gives warmth and happiness to others. The difference is just that I wish to do so in terms of music, and that I haven’t succeeded yet.

Though it has only been a couple of weeks since I know you, you have become one of my biggest motivations for doing what I love, and most importantly, living on, just like how Pekora Senpai meant to you.

If you were just a friend of mine I would have just fallen in love (laughs). You have been fighting so hard. Please keep on but also take care as well. It is always okay to rest for a bit.

I love you, Kiara.

To NaGeL

You are the first one that got to me when I was a little broken down then. You are also the first one that donated to me. Thanks a million!

To Akel

Thanks for your drawing! I really love it, though I wish there would be coloring (laughs). Also thanks for supporting my piano playing.

To Nonono / Clan / Egguca and other talented musicians

I really enjoyed your performance. I hope we can collab some day!

To All KFP members

I really have to thank you all for supporting me and encouraging me to play the piano. You guys have been the new spiritual support for me, and KFP has become a new home on the Internet for me. Thank you all. I love you guys.

The journey has just started. Viva la Kiara! Viva la KFP!

So my story ain’t special, just an ex-weeb stumbling upon Miko’s n-word clip, and my reaction was pretty much: “Oh no, Anyways...”


I was aware of the AI channel, but due to the language barrier never got hooked on.

So I moved on, but the concept of virtual avatars interested me, so I searched on. I found Ironmouse and nyanyers, but I only watched clips of em, I didn’t like their live streams at all, or rather I don’t like twitch and its culture.


So for a while, I just stayed with their clips. I went on to search for more Vtubers, and I found AICandy and ComfyRanma, and some other Australian and Scottish Vtubers respectively. Tried to get into their streams and community but something didn’t click with me. They’re great, don't get me wrong, just they might not be for me.


Youtube then recommended more hololive clips to me for a while, which I watched, but again the language barrier pretty much killed any interest in watching them live.

See I got a fatal flaw: If I don’t understand something I either work very hard to understand it, or I ignore it.

With hololive it initially fell to the ignore pile since I didn't have time to learn japanese.

Then a friend of mine told me they announced HololiveEN. With the one thing that made me ignore Hololive being resolved, I got hooked.


I loved the concept art and two stood out for me: Ina and Calli.

Confession time: Kiara was dead last for me, she seemed boring to me.


When they started using Twitter, I brought out my dead Twitter account and Tweetdeck and started following them. I loved Ina’s put and Calli’s well boomer vibes.

Another confession: I found Kiara annoying at that time. So I ignored her.

The debuts were in a timeframe for me where I could watch it all live back to back. Which I did.

Calli: I can’t believe my boomer reaper is this cute. Fell in love and was a proud deadbeat.

Ina: I love her concept, her puns, but her voice... I can’t handle her type of voice and pretty much puts me to sleep. Hell, I use her Vods as sleeping aids. If I can’t fall asleep I just put her on and in 30 minutes I’m sleeping.

Gura: Memer. She was ok in my book and that’s about it.

Amelia: The crazy lady, that indeed to follow.

Kiara:... I was surprised that I wasn’t annoyed by her...she was even endearing.


So at first, I tried to follow all of them, but time didn’t allow it, so I slowly dropped Ina, Gura, then Ame., and somehow remained with Calli and Kiara.

Okay, the whole Takamori thing helped a lot: I love Tsunderes and hopeless romantics which the two of em fitted to a T.


It took me a while. In fact, it took me a decent amount of time to really see who she was, beyond just the character. But the moment I did, I fell in love with her.

So since then, I started supporting her wholeheartedly, joined the community, and didn’t regret it once.

I might not be the most vocal, or noticeable guy, but believe me, I am in the background and supporting her and the community as whole.

KFP makes me happy, and I am proud to say that I am a part of it. I really don’t remember when I got into Vtubers but I know seeing clips was definitely the gateway like others. I knew about Kizuna A.I. when she was the only one and tried to get into it but the language barrier turned me away, and I just kept to anime and my school life at the time.


Years pass and I’m not really doing anything with my life nor socializing, just working and laying in bed after until it was time for work again. Even though I play games with Voice chat in them, I don’t speak that often because of a slur in my voice, just isolating myself. Pikamee was the first Vtuber I got into because of her bilingual streams, allowing me to enjoy it, then all the clips started to come and so did Hololive EN.


A 4 hour trip to visit family allowed me to just focus on them, with nothing else to really distract me from it. I watched Amellia and Calli streams on the way, then just listened to Calli raps and Gura sing “Ride On Time” on the way back, and finished with Ina and Kiara when I got back home. I’ll admit, Kiara took some time to get into. I wanted to like all of them and I joined her first MC stream and just enjoyed it, the first one I watched on my T.V. instead of my phone.


Yeah, they can all make me smile and laugh but with Kiara, I could relate with. The memories are hazy but I remember just listening to her talk and just being,” Yeah, I know how that feels”. I remember getting off of work one morning, still in the lobby and becoming a member just to catch the first members only stream, my first subscription to a Hololive member, and only one for the moment. It wasn’t until the Nether RTA stream that I actually super chatted for the first time, and I just wanted to cheer her up. I didn’t really care if some would call it a waste of money, I just didn’t want to see and hear her cry.


 I stayed up for over 24 hours because I didn’t sleep after I got home from work and watched that stream, but because of me super chatting for the first time and knowing a superchat reading was happening, I just stayed up because I didn’t want to miss it. Did I have to do it, no. Was I pressured to do it, no, it was a heat of the moment decision. When I heard her say my name, it filled me with joy, just to be noticed and get my message read out and that tangent about us becoming chickens to soon be eaten by her and get my name called again, it made me feel there. Then I joined the discord, and just like I do with streams and other discords, I just lurked for a while.


 Then I just started to talk outta nowhere, just wanted to make my presence, and was welcomed. I still have some trouble making myself type in it, but it’s the first discord I made myself speak in in order to get to know others, and become part of a new group. Yeah I may not be known like others but in time I can make a name for myself, somehow. They’re great, giving and supportive people and I get to be with them. Now I’m here, mainly watching Kiara, do I want to watch others, yeah, but with my wants and time frame, Kiara is the best I got to watch and focus on. I may not be there at every stream or even watch each and every archive to support but, I'm here. I’m happy to sometimes just join a stream and get sucked into it, whatever it may be. It helps me escape from reality for a bit, and just not feel alone.


 That’s probably the best part, a virtual hangout session with a group of friends that all love what’s going on, with every streamer. To push back my isolation by being with someone that makes me smile because my schedule is different from my few friends, it helps a lot. How to end this would just be a thank you. Thank you Kiara, for being the one I could feel like I could just be a friend with and tell my problems to and vice versa, and just make each other feel better. If I couldn’t see her model again, I would be okay with that, just to hear her emotions through her voice is more than enough.


Thank you KFP, for bringing all these great people together to support one another and welcoming me in, not making me feel alone and giving me confidence to actually be out there. Yeah I wish I can support everyone from Hololive but the first one is you, because I love to help out friends, would even go to hell and back just to see a pure hearted smile.




# UnstoppablePhoenix


Let's start at the very beginning with what led me into Hololive in the first place.


I was doing alright in school, but with covid and other work piling up around me, I was feeling a lot more worried, nervous and anxious about the year. I'm browsing Reddit to take my mind off things when I notice the announcement post for HololiveEN on r/all. Naturally being confused about Hololive, I did some research into it and it turns out that the random clips I was watching of this dog girl (who I learned pretty quickly into the research to be Korone) was a member. With the EN market present, I fell very quickly and deeply into the hole.


If we're talking about Kiara specifically, I ended up missing her debut stream because it was at 2am (this was back when I had decent sleeping habits). I wake up, browse the debut megathread and find out some pretty amazing things had happened in the stream. I stopped reading them, watched the archive and immediately fell in love with her. Something about her personality, bottom left nature and being a fellow phoenix resonated with me. I finally felt at ease and at home. Gone were the days of being worried about major life concerns, for my worries had been replaced by Hololive.


And then, on the 22nd of November, 2020, I used Korotagger in the Kiara Fan Discord, and tagged my first Kiara stream moment. Since then, I've had a love and an addiction to tagging. Kiara will hold a place in my heart as an enjoyable member to tag for, because I know there will always be an exciting, amazing, lewd, or otherwise memorable moment right around the corner.


Tenchou may be my boss, but she is also the best friend a person could have. Thank you Kiara, from the bottom of my Hololive-filled heart.




# FoodMe


Well I really want to be part of the history books, so here is my tale.

Earlier this year I have no single clue what Hololive, Cover Corps, or Hololive idols are.

I've heard their names... But I did not dwell into it any deeper.

I knew what V-Tubing was, but I thought that it was not as famous as normal creators.

I've only seen a few clips of V-Tubers on Instagram and on YouTube like Pikamee, and Pekora, it made me laugh but it did not really drag me in.

In the past few months, many clips had been popping up on my Recommended page on YouTube. I tried to stay away from it because I didn’t want to fall into the rabbit hole and make my inner-otaku get any bigger.

So I tried my best to stay away from it because I used to think that Anime, Manga, and Light Novels are more superior to V-Tubing and it's just an unknown person with a mask behind it.

Then a few weeks later (This was a few days later after their debut), while avoiding V-Tubers on YouTube, a certain video kept on popping up on my recommended page: it was Gura's "A" video.

I was surprised that it had gained so many views and then one day, I decided to watch it.

After watching the video, I scrolled down to see any related videos like this.

And there was a clip of Calli, and it was the "American vs Canadian Superchat war" and that caught my attention. While watching the video and the part where she cried in the video, it made me want to support her and it also made me more curious about Hololive.


So I watched more clips of Hololive EN and I've learnt about the other Hololive EN members,

The members that caught my interest were Calli and Amelia.

I had fun watching and laughing at their clips but realised that I couldn’t catch their streams. While watching a clip of Ame, a video of WooHooLad popped up and it was a clip of Kiara crying. The reason for her crying was because of one SuperChat which led her to talk about how she is not talented compared to her genmates.

Then WooHooLad actually pointed out how great she is, like she is the type of person that brightens up the mood in the room, she can speak different languages and many more to mention.


So I went and visited her channel while she was streaming Minecraft with her first shaders. My initial thought was that she had fewer subscribers than the others.

So I watched her stream and instantly liked her. She is a very relatable person, a "bit" perverted, and truly a bird brain. She was the first V-Tuber & Hololive member that I've dedicated myself to watching. I kept on watching her while learning about the rabbit hole.

Then shortly after, I joined the Discord server. Now, I believe I made the right choice in following her.


That is my tale.



# Ruyi
This might get a bit personal but I guess that's the point of an origin story. 2020 was, on a personal level, a pretty bad year. I might go as far as to say it was the 2nd worst year in my life. The kind of year where you have to make up your own motivation to get up in the morning, because the world won't give you any, and would give you hope with certain things just to take it away right in front of your eyes.


That's where I was for the most part. As many others, the pandemic changed my schedule and gave me a lot of free time I usually didn't have, specifically the time I used to spend going to college and coming back home. I never was a person who goes outside a lot, so that aspect of the lockdown didn't really affect me, but at the moment I couldn't possibly imagine how much I needed those 4 hours of relative peace I had when I went to class. The rabbit hole appeared around March, by the time I was supposed to start college again. My journey began with Kizuna Ai. I watched her DDLC playthrough, then watched a compilation of different VTubers reacting to a certain scene involving Monika (that's when I knew what VTubers were), and from there I found Nijisanji. Eventually I stepped in a Miko GTA Online clip, and from there I fell deeper and deeper in Hololive.


The day HoloMyth debuted was pretty interesting. From the preview, I felt Kiara would probably be my favorite from her generation, purely because she was a phoenix, my favorite mythological creature. The Friday before the debuts I did a lot of stuff in my house, so I ended up pretty tired but was determined to watch all the streams the next day. I found myself really proud of myself when I managed to wake up for Calli's debut (it was at 8AM for me), and I thought I could do it, because between Kiara's and Ina's there were a few hours I could use to sleep a bit more. But of course, I'm still me and I fell asleep when the first stream ended, and woke up around 12PM, one hour after Kiara's debut was over. I remember thinking to myself that Kiara would surely be my favorite, based on the fact that I missed her debut and it seemed a very "me" thing to do. I watched Ina's live, and between hers and Gura's I watched Kiara's, and I just LOVED it. That night the first collab took place and Kiara just kept getting points. It might sound weird, but Kiara has everything I could ask for in an entertainer, and more. Her personality gave me heavy Yui vibes (from K-ON, aka my favorite anime character ever), she rickrolled a lot (and Rickrolls are a thing I unironically love), like I mentioned she's my favorite mythological creature, and we even share birthday and she's left-handed! (that's why I always put the sword emote on the left hand when we have a battle emergency in the chat) I saved the best part for the end, but her eyes are honestly the best any VTuber could ever have, seriously.


I was inspired by the other viewers to come out with a KFP job, and I spent maybe a bit too much time thinking about it. I took into consideration what was needed in such a company. At the time, we had a General, so I thought about following that lead, and I decided for Chicken Trainer, because someone had to teach those chickens how to fight to protect our beloved Mama Tenchou. But, just like in the mysterious Phoenix Burger, there's a hidden truth in my job. Training them for war doesn't just mean teaching them how to defeat and even slay our enemies, it also means to prepare them for death. In the end, we're all going to be eaten, understanding and accepting that is a requirement to join the glorious KFP, so I decided to take responsibility for preparing the employees for their inevitable fate. We are chickens, we take pride in our serving. Glory to KFP!




I missed the membership announcement stream too (because like I said earlier, I'm still me), and didn't want to wait until the next stream to join because I felt she was giving me a lot of joy, and if I could afford being a day 1 member, I had to. There are people in this world that I don't support more just because I can't, and Kiara is one of them. I won't get into detail because I don't want this story to be sad, but her streams were a beam of happiness when I needed it the most. I realized when writing the next sentence that it might contradict what I said a bit earlier, but I have to mention it. There's a clip of her saying that she gave up on a dream before, and honestly that's what gave me the most strength in that moment. The stories of people never giving up on their dreams are surely inspiring, but I'm someone who couldn't keep up with the negativity. I reached the point where I couldn't convince myself that my dreams were still reachable, and I gave up, accepting that there are things I'll never be able to do. And that Kiara clip made me realize she reached that point too, and she got back up again. That's the kind of strength I really admire, the kind of strength I want to have. That Majestic Phoenix had it. And I knew I had to support her however I could to make sure she won't lose it.


# Reggie Steele

About two weeks prior to the Holomyth debut streams, I had already fallen into the Hololive rabbit hole. I didn’t know a whole lot about Vtubers, but I was still excited and nervous to see what Holomyth would bring to the table. I stayed up throughout the whole debut marathon and even watched Kiara’s sleep-deprived Fall Guys stream at the very end. From the first day I could already tell that Kiara was a hard worker and I was curious to see how things would turn out for her.


Unfortunately, I was still in college around that time and all of Kiara’s streams were during my morning classes. As a result, I couldn’t watch her streams live and at the time I didn’t like watching archives, so I didn’t get to really see what Kiara was like. Even worse, at the time there weren’t a lot of channels who were clipping Kiara’s content, so I didn’t even have any clips to watch of her either. Then one day, I saw Kiara tweet about a clip made by Nexat. I found myself laughing and thinking “why is this the only person I see clipping these streams when they’re so hilarious?” I was really confused by how no one was really talking about Kiara at the time and I also felt bad that I was missing out on her streams.


As time went on, I eventually started to watch her archived streams because I wanted to see more than just a couple of clips and I found myself hooked on her content. She was funny, cute, slightly vulgar, and affectionate in a unique way that I couldn’t find from any other streamer. But the thing that made me decide to join KFP and become a full Kiara fan was her hardworking nature and determination. Seeing her give her all despite everything that she had to go through at the beginning was inspiring. I soon found myself joining her membership and trying to catch every one of her streams even if I had a class at the same time.


After a while I even started to interact with other KFP members because I respected how much they supported Kiara. Everyone in the KFP community truly is special and I couldn’t imagine life without them. I thank Kiara every day for managing to build such an amazing community who loves her just as much as I do. Being able to talk about her streams and participate in community projects has been a lot of fun and I’m looking forward to seeing what’s in store for both Kiara and KFP in the future.



# Schrodinger04

My backstory is cliche like others. Quarantined, bored, and discovering Hololive EN. Initially, I already knew about Hololive JP and I mainly only watched clips as I always told myself that I don't have time to watch a full stream and also because I can't understand Japanese. But oh boy did I not expect to watch Kiara for 11 hours straight in the future.

 Time passes, debut time is here and I admit that I didn't watch them live but I watched the archive and I still struggled to watch that 1 hour stream. As usual like any others, Gura, Amelia, and Calli stood out while Ina and Kiara were left out. Then, in the first week after the debut, I was watching the 2nd EN collab which was on Kiara's channel and I would say that was the stream which made me a fan of her but I wasn’t quite a KFP Employee yet.

 However, fast forward to the present day I have become addicted to Kiara's content. After like 1 month I made myself a KFP YouTube name thanks to other people having those names too. Also, I have a general rule of not spending money online and being a member costs money, but that thing changed my mind and made me become a KFP member is when I learned that my friend last year (before quarantine) also watched Hololive and it surprised me that his Oshi is Kiara too.
I also made some Discord and Twitter friends and chatting with them while Kiara is streaming is always fun. I would also like to thank Kiara for inspiring me to do artworks even though I'm still a beginner and to do my best to do my duties before her stream. So up until now, I would still watch Kiara and I must say that I have watched every stream she had except for the early movie watch-along stream... But don't worry I'll watch it when I get time!



# BetaLixT

During the initial vtuber boom (Kizuna Ai era), I never really understood it much and never really got into it. But it’s the usual rabbit hole (literally in my case lol) story: I saw a Pekora clip and ever since then I’ve been yeeted into this endless pit with no warning. From a random Pekora minecraft clip to hilarious PekoMiko clips to the famous Miko GTA clips and from there it was just an endless spiral….. All of the girls were great so I’ve been watching a few of them here and there but I was mostly watching Watame, Pekora and Pikamee streams. I got into vtubers around the start of quarantine and it’s not really a big surprise, watching streams was basically a sort of escapism from my terrible job where I’m essentially working the entire day (my home being my office didn’t help a bit).


And now, a couple of months later, comes the holoEN announcement!!  Idk why but I honestly had no expectations, but staying up all night watching the debuts, all of the girls just completely blew me away!! Calli’s rapping, Kiara’s bubbly personality and her singing, Ina’s relaxed voice and nature and also her art, Gura’s cuteness and singing and finally Ame’s wild ride. For the first week I actually somehow caught every holoEN stream, If it were possible I would watch everyone!!! But I eventually found my favorite and I have stuck with that adorable birb since then.


To be honest I’m not the greatest at describing why I like things, I’m not one to really think much about it and I just love what I love, but in retrospective I think the most important thing is that I just absolutely love listening to Kiara speak, I love how she wears her heart on her sleeve, I love how she just keep talking and goes on tangents, I love how she just pulls out random stuff it’s hilarious, especially lately with the goxlr shenanigans. Just something about kiara and her streams, I just feel a connection I guess, it feels more personal and that’s something I didn’t really get from the other streamers. Also another note is that I’ve never really been one to take part in communities in the past and even here I’m not a very active member (I’m not one to talk much) but I really love the community around Kiara and it’s the very first time that I felt like I was part of one.



# King Mufasa


 I fell down the rabbit hole two days after discovering it in the early summer of 2020. Due to a recommendation of a vtuber, I realized that these streamers were actually more interesting than I originally thought. After hours of sorting through clips, it didn’t take long to stumble upon hololive. I instantly got invested in their relationships and funny content. Unfortunately, I have no knowledge of Japanese so I could never truly enjoy the experience of these wonderful and hardworking people.


Due to this fact, I nearly lost my interest in vtubers, until one random day at midnight an announcement dropped for Hololive English. I was surprised, but excited. When I first saw Kiara, I don’t recall any specific feelings I had for her. It’s not that I wasn’t interested in her, she just didn’t exactly stand out the most. Originally, I thought she would be the super hyper and crazy one, especially because of how she interacted on Twitter. And I’d say this assumption was still pretty accurate tbh. Then finally, the debuts. Kiara’s debut was super adorable, I loved the intro and her voice was extremely cute. I was super interested in the fact that she was so fluent in 3 languages, and that she was a mega simp just like me.


I guess her reacting to Pekora like that made me feel more welcomed. But the real turning point was the infamous superchat reading. It was peaceful and comfy, until she read that superchat. The moment her voice started breaking down, I could already feel my heart breaking in two. She was so precious, and the attention she brought to feeling lackluster compared to the other girls was something I deeply related to, even though for her it was entirely untrue lol.


That moment made me want to follow and support her forever, due to how genuine and open she was. Soon after, she started super Mario. I’ve never laughed so hard at 2 AM in my life, she was so ridiculously funny that I couldn’t help but love her even more. She became a real joy in my life, and seeing her do things like interact with the community and open up more and more just keeps adding more fuel to my simping fire. Of all the hololive girls, I feel the most emotionally invested in Kiara which means once that 3D debut and 1 million stream comes, I’ll definitely shed tears which I haven’t done in a while.


Whether she’s being super lewd, or completely wholesome, there is no one I'd rather spend 6-9 hours of each day with. Although I don’t comment during streams a lot, I have never missed a stream and I am starting to interact more with this wonderful community that she has created. I’m hoping to upgrade my editing skills to hopefully one day make something special for her, but that will come way later. I can’t wait for the day when she finally has more confidence in herself and realizes that we are all here to stay, till then and always, i will continue to support my amazing mama. Viva la Kiara and GLORY TO TAKAMORI!!!!!!


# Mence

2020 was on track to being the worst year of my life (that dishonour is currently given to 2015). I had one primary goal, to debut in my new Flyball team and take back the British and European record. The pieces were almost in place for us to seize it, and then the world locked down. Competitions shut down across the world and the flyballing world entered limbo. Over time, this killed my drive and my passion for the dog sport. Since I’m not a social person and I didn’t interact with many people, working from home kept eating away at me. Eventually, I kind of stopped feeling anything. It was the only thing I could think of to get rid of the bad thoughts.


Fast forward through six miserable months to September, when Hololive debuted their first English generation. The only thing I knew about Hololive before this was the collaboration they did with Azur Lane back in 2019. At first, I checked out Gura, as she was the one most were talking about on Twitter. I had fun with her debut stream, so I checked out the others, followed by the collab on Ame’s channel. I liked the dynamic that Kiara and Calli had with each other. From there, I started watching both of their solo streams. And then, Kiara’s first superchat reading happened... Listening to her open up about the insecurities that she had was what made me want to stay. She kept pushing on despite the technical issues she had and that inspired me to push on with my own life. Her being a huge Nintendo fan is an added bonus! In a way, Kiara’s really relatable to me. We share some of the same fears so seeing her overcome them gives me the confidence to overcome mine.


Joining KFP has been exactly what I needed. I can feel my confidence increasing every time I interact with the community and Kiara! In a way, she’s given me a second shot at life!



# God of Amiibo
My KFP backstory isn’t as exciting as some others, but through 2020, I was also stuck in doors with little to do.  I watch a LOT of YouTube, so it was only a matter of time the algorithm suggested to me Im.Scatman, and from there, it was history.  After that, I watched a ton of clips that came up in my recommended videos, until I heard about Hololive English.  I watched all of the debuts live that day.


Right from the get-go, Kiara’s rendition of Shiny Smiley Story made me emotional.  Which was weird, considering I was only just meeting her.  But her being a fan of Pekora and freaking out earlier made me think, “Wow, this girl’s a fan just like we are.  I’m so happy she made it!” And as time went on, I gravitated more to her over the others.  Her streaming persona and atmosphere was so much fun.


And eventually, I joined the fan Discord and followed a bunch of amazing people on Twitter!  I don’t go to the fan Discord that often these days, but I love interacting with Kiara and her fans on Twitter to this day!  Funny story: God of Amiibo was just a throwaway name I used for Discord when I joined other servers I didn’t intend to use, because I used my real name on my ‘main’ server.  But after joining the Discord and getting to know people there, I changed my Twitter and Youtube names to match, and the rest is history!

It was October of 2020, and while I was browsing Youtube I saw a video of ‘Plague of Gripes’ that seemed interesting. It was a timelapse of a drawing of Kiara he made for halloween. By that time I was already familiarized with vtubers, but I had no interest in Hololive or any other company. It was pure prejudice admittedly, but I had a reasonable distaste for company based youtubers, a lot of bad examples sadly.


Anyway, the drawing seemed interesting and I wondered what he had to say about it.

During the time lapse video, he talked about imposter syndrome, about the image of ourselves we project to others when we develop relationships, specifically parasocial relationships, and the personal struggles of someone in the entertainment industry, particularly in the context of vtubers.

He talked about Kiara and her talents, but also her worries and insecurities regarding herself she had at the time, while also offering some words of encouragement.


Certainly it wasn't what I expected, such vulnerability and humanity from a company hired entertainer. I had to see it for myself.

What I found was a tremendously entertaining, hardworking and honest individual, that even if she didn't talk about it, you could tell has passed through a lot, and just like the phoenix she is, rose from the ashes. Someone that even in the darkest days could bring a smile out of you. An example, an inspiration. If that's not what an idol is, I don't know what is.


I have only been able to become a member recently, (a good opportunity presented itself during the KUUKIYOMI 3 stream), and haven’t participated in the community much. I just wanted to support one of my favorite creators, the one that introduced me to all of Hololive, it's not more complicated than that. I hope she is successful and finds enjoyment in whatever she does in the future. Even if all this is just a small moment in either of our lives, I’ll always be grateful for it.


Good luck Kiara, and never stop having fun.

I've watched many youtubers and twitch streamers over the years and I've always been someone to lurk and watch from the sidelines.

Even for a youtuber I've watched for over 10 years up until present day, I've never actively engaged in the community. It just didn't appeal to me, what reason was there to engage with it, it seemed like a waste of time.


I was only vaguely aware of the existence of vtubers back when Kizuna Ai began, the concept seemed interesting but it never caught my attention.

Flash forward a couple of years and we're in 2020, where the world is crippled in the midst of Covid and everyone has too much free time on their hands.

I began getting slow exposure to vTubers from Facebook and 9gag due to cursed clips like the one with Miko playing GTA5, and from convention friends posting meme's and updates on the vast array of HoloLive idols they were following.

I was indeed curious, but I didn't want to take the dive into a fandom that already had a plethora of history that I'd probably struggle to wade through on my own. It seemed like a daunting task for me which turned me away from exploring further.

Then came late August or early September where I caught wind of HoloLiveEN, the debuts of five girls who were Cover's answer to expanding to the western market. If ever I was going to get into this fandom I had to do it from the start, there was no other way for me.


I remember the night I watched the girls debuts, it was Calli and Kiara first up one after the other. I watched Calli and really enjoyed her stream.

Next was Kiara, I loved that she was multilingual, she had such a strong passion for Japan and idols I could feel her energy infecting me through the screen. Kiara was so sweet, cute, a joker but also honest to a fault.

But I couldn't help but feel something different, Kiara hit me as this person who you just couldn't help but love. Her personality was magnetic but I realised something else about Kiara, she was desperately trying to show the world everything she has to offer.

She wasn't trying to just tell part of the audience but ALL of the audience, Kiara was live-translating herself in English and Japanese from her native German, she wanted to entertain everyone and give us as much of her time as possible. I couldn't help but start garnering respect for her right from the start.


Then came the end of Kiara's debut, people were starting to leave the stream. Kiara asked everyone not to leave, that she wasn't done yet. I could hear it in her voice, someone who has something to share with the world and wants to prove it.

It was at that moment I decided that I wanted to see for myself what Kiara wanted to show us. I won't leave her, I want to support her, and maybe with my help and support her dreams can come true.


From Kiara's debut I was a fan, with each passing day I learnt more about Kiara. And with each passing day I found more reasons to like and support her. Kiara is always giving it everything she's got, always trying to improve herself and her streams. She's so supportive of her genmates and senpais/kouhais.

She provides us entertainment but she is also very sincere with us, treating her fans like family.

I can't help but appreciate how honest she is and how thankful she is for our support be it big or small.


The KFP timeline is full of hardships and triumphs and I was there for all of it. I saw how Kiara dealt with hardware issues, internet issues, moving houses, channel terminations, shadow bans, flying back home to "Australia" and more.

Through all these hardships Kiara has risen above them and grown stronger each and every time. She released multiple songs, her own singles as well as covers. She made a talk show to interview other HoloLive talents to spread awareness and grow the fandom.

Her gaming streams are all memorable as she gives them her all each time, and whenever there is a superchat stream her stories, tangents and general interaction with her community make for the most comfortable streams and lets not forget how amazing her Karaoke streams are because Kiara is a true Idol.


Kiara has grown a community around her which I am proud to be a part of. I have made many new friends from our mutual love of Kiara and I am grateful for that. The last 8 months have seen me go from a lurker to someone active within an online community and I feel comfortable being here.

From the beginnings in stream pre-chats, to KFP discord and smaller private discord groups as well as Twitter I have grown a lot. This online community has helped a lot of people with our collective support for each other through everyone's own personal hardships and that has been such a blessing.


So I will continue to support you Takanashi Kiara, you're my KFP 10chou, my imaginary internet girlfriend but more than that I would consider you a friend.

Whatever you endeavor to do I would like to be there and back you 100% because I believe in you. Whatever your goals are I hope that you achieve them, so please make your dreams come true.



# Eugenie C

Hello, Tenchou, I am Eugenie, a KFP employee from Hong Kong. Before the hololiveEN debut, I was already watching hololiveJP but they didn’t drag me into the rabbit hole as deep as you did. I love all the talents in HololiveJP, but I barely know Japanese. Although I was learning Japanese at that time, I was not confident in Japanese writing. I could only type “草” in chat and watch the translated clips after live stream. When HololiveEN debuted, I could finally type something in Chat!


To be honest, I was not a fan of Kiara at the very beginning. The experience of you and Calli living in Japan was the part that attracted me. I have thought of going to Japan for work after graduation, maybe a real job or working holiday like what you have done. At that time I was a bit uncertain, but seeing you leaving your cats, family for Japan. I felt a bit encouraged, maybe I can also try first! Both of you and Calli are very brave to leave your home country. Leaving my comfort zone is something I’ve never tried in my life. I love seeing Tenchou always try something new and creative like Holotalks (I love the series so much) and playing games that you are not good at. You just always try your best, that's what I learned from you. Therefore, I keep watching your live streams!


Later, I found Kiara was the only streamer that occupied my nighttime lmao, and I slowly became your fan! Kiara is the only streamer that would stream till late night (in my time). Whenever I am doing college assignments or revisions, your voice will be around. I really love hearing your energetic and cheering voice when I feel tired at night. Like the tarot in Calli's Red MV, you really look like a Sun, bright and essential. I can’t imagine the nights without Kiara. College is very stressful and tough. I have thought of giving up many times but reminding myself with your past experience, now I think maybe everything has a meaning. At least now I know the English lessons from the past 15 years have a meaning. Whenever I feel tired of living, I will think about your streams like what your next stream will be like, every time I would find some funny moments and surprisingly the long stream never gets boring. Life is like that too, it may be boring but maybe there are always some interesting moments that you would enjoy.


After your first YouTube ban, I decided to become a member of your channel, seeing your madness return in an interesting stream. Your sense of humor, your way of dealing with injustice, and your optimism, are the things that make me think you're a real phoenix, a sincere phoenix. I appreciate your inner beauty more than your pretty appearance. Maybe that’s why Vtubers are attracting too. You are the one I want to support you no matter what and would never want to see you cry. Even if I have a boyfriend in the future, I will keep saying that, I promise!


Thank you for bringing sunshine and happiness to my life. I will continue supporting you although I cannot join every single stream because of my health condition and time zone issues. I’m never gonna give you up! I hope my knowledge can be contributed to the KFP community, making some good fan games or related apps. Although I'm still not financially independent and I don’t have much money, I promise I will give you a pinky or red Superchat whenever I am able to! I love you so much, Tenchou!



# DOMINIK K


I first discovered Hololive in April of 2020 and watched a few streams to improve my japanese a little bit. I’ve been an anime fan for over a decade now, so it was a nice gimmick to see streamers with anime avatars being able to reach out and resonate with their fans.

That fascination didn’t hold for long, the language barrier being the biggest problem and so I thought: I just am not interested in vTubers


When Hololive EN debuted I followed everyone’s debuts and watched a few streams and you are all truly amazing in your own regards! I just watched a few of the streams and the early collab ones pretty passively. My free time was short and so I thought:
I just am not interested in vTubers.


That changed when I saw the 300k clip with the 4th stage cancer SC. I’ve seen many facets of Takanashi Kiara, but that was the first time I saw her be that concerned and handling such a tough situation with a heartfelt response. And seeing someone with a big heart, struggling and doing her very best resonated with me a lot!
So I rewatched all the streams I missed and started following her from there on. I began to think: Maybe these vTubers is worth a shot!


And because I liked the JRPGs Kiara streamed, I tried watching her live more often. And I was just amazed by how friendly and supportive the people in chat before and after the stream were! I got in contact with some very great people and even greater chickens.

If not for them I wouldn’t have stuck around for so long, because I thought:
Maybe this KFP community is worth a shot!


I’ve seen a few streams and the months went on. Times in JRPG streams when chat died down and a message or two got reacted to by Tenchou were very fun! And I was glad that Tenchou could sometimes pretty openly share her feelings and even react to our feedback: That was something unexpected. And everyone was very supportive. So I thought:

This community really is a great place to be in!


And then came the Hololive 2nd fes watchalong. And I saw the amazing energy of Kiara Takanashi, fan-girl par excellence. Even without a ticket I just had to cheer alongside her. And that moment never faded away. That may be hard to understand, but I even bought a ticket afterwards and had the concert of a lifetime.  It was the same experience for bloom later on. And I thought: I want to cheer Kiara on like she cheered for her fellow members!


After that moment I made my first twitter account, and was surprised by the amazing atmosphere. Our Tenchou’s ability to entertain us even on twitter and interact with us, and the support from Twitter KFP was great! And there are other places for fans to gather too

So many people gathered and did their very best for this community.

So I wanted to give it my very best too!


Now after 8 months I still find new and interesting people to talk to and we will even be able to see a small wish of Kiara fulfilled: Her entrance at the first international digital convention DigiKomi is something she wished for in November of last year.  

And I’m looking forward to many milestones. Numbers aren’t important, except those on the bank account, but the memories and emotions I shared with you all will be here for my life!
I cried for hours after a certain collab concert, was cheering on and discussing many things with all kinds of fans. And I really, really appreciate Kiara being open and connecting with us!
That’s something I hope won’t change. I hate putting people on a pedestal, and I think:
Kiara is a splendid entertainer, idol when on stage and
a great fangirl and super supportive and considerate person!

I wish her only the best! As I wish for all the fellow KFP members reading this.
Love you all (platonically)!



# Lenaroux


As I like to say, unlike other things that attract my attention at first by their looks, Kiara was a case apart. I remember seeing the "Hololive English" banner and not exactly paying attention to her, because I had only been in the "rabbit hole" for a short time and didn't have an opinion about her - just like for the other girls. I heard criticisms about her design before her debut, but it was not something that I gave importance to at the moment because it was all new to me.


When I watched her debut I could feel the nervousness in her voice, however, more than this I noticed that she was kind of brave. I wasn't an active person in the community before December, but I remember watching some of Kiara's streams, not talking in the chat, just following from afar and seeing how hard it was for her in the beginning. In October, after the "membership announcement" stream, I found myself watching her streams from beginning to end and made my first fanart of her. On the last day of the year, I decided to become a member and started interacting on Twitter again.


Seeing everything she went through, from having her channel terminated to the many house moves she had to do to finally have a place of her liking to live and do her work...For an artist like me who felt unmotivated and didn't have the courage to step up and chase my own dreams, Kiara made a huge difference in my life. It was not because of all the bad things that happened that she stopped being someone who supports her coworkers and cares about them, who makes absurdly long streams in order to entertain her audience, who truly appreciates those who give a little of their time to her - and shows it.


It's all about time. The time I took to see the path she has taken since the beginning is what made me feel truly part of the community, and I am very grateful to Kiara for that.



# KP Shadow


I started watching hololive because it was suddenly recommended to me by youtube (Aki’s ARK). At first, I didn’t find the appeal in them as you just watch stream for hours playing games and just talking UNTIL I saw that they make original songs and covers like Shally’s (I like singing and listening to songs so that made me interested) and since then I always tune in to karaoke and song premieres. (mostly Aki’s though)

Then, HoloEN/Holomyth showed up and I got curious as to how it will go, so I waited and prepared for their “1 day” whole generation debut. I watched the VOD (I woke up late) of Calli’s debut while waiting for Kiara’s and found that yes, I’ll prepare for cringe… a lot of it. (It was great overall and watching everything was worth the wait)

I mostly tuned in to Kiara as the streams started when I woke up. I got attached because of the scuffs, the moving, on how she handles those problems, and of course her interaction with viewers. I got hooked at those interactions, her tangents, long streams and sometimes her struggles in gaming. The way she wears her heart in her sleeves, planning collabs and dynamics with the others, making the best out of dire situations (YT ban), her art style, her voice and songs, and her overall care for both her genmates and fanbase is what captured my heart and made me support her.

Then I decided to make an account and join the discord server. To my surprise, most of them are already close and they held various mini events and karaoke for the community and for Kiara, I just lurked though as I’m very busy last year. A big mistake was not interacting that early but right now I’m doing my best to make time and have fun with them. (After all, they are like family)

All in all, I love Kiara Takanashi and the KFP community for they help me relieve the stress of the real world and make me laugh through all their interactions, motivating me to do my best and bring back past hobbies like making art and singing (I’d love to join KFP karaoke one day). I can’t express how much I appreciate it except by saying this, “Thank you and I love you all”.


# Blaster Jungle

My story begins on the day of the Gen 5 debuts. Another friend of mine sent me the link, saying that I should take a look. At the time, I was relatively bored. Quarantine in my country prevented us from going anywhere other than for work or essentials, so that left me watching a fair amount of Youtube on a daily basis. At the time, I found myself gravitating toward Lamy the most, though as with many people here, the language barrier proved to be one of my biggest obstacles. Despite my recent entry into the rabbit hole, the events which followed (and shall not be recounted) proved to grab my heart and bind it to the rabbit hole until the present day.


Fast forward about a month, and I had settled into a relative normalcy. While I didn’t have a consistent schedule for catching streams, I would catch them whenever I could. And while I couldn’t fully understand what was being said, my long exposure to the internet proved to aid me in understanding at least part of it. And then came the announcement that HoloEN was debuting. I was interested, mostly for the same reasons as many others: the removal of the language barrier, and the designs themselves. I resolved that I would watch all of the debut streams.


That was a promise quickly broken, as my body decided that after Ina’s stream that it was time to give up and sent me into dreamland. However, at the time, I had resolved that Ina was probably my favorite out of the bunch, with Calli as a close second. And in reality, I didn’t pay a whole lot of attention to Kiara. However, in the following weeks, I began to see a lot of clips of Kiara. I saw the clips of her reacting to the stage 4 cancer SC, and the ones of her playing various games. And I began to gravitate to her energy, her enthusiasm and her overall demeanor. The way that she faced life head on was encouraging and impressive, and I felt empowered by that. She wore her heart on her sleeve, and while that left her open, it also allowed us to connect with her in a unique way I feel. One that is irreplaceable. 


In the time that passed, I continued on with life. While I still enjoy Ina’s content, I generally do find myself watching Kiara more often, and I remain a member of both communities. In fact, Kiara was the first person that I superchatted to, and that I have no regrets about. Unfortunately with the time zone change, I tend to find it difficult to catch Kiara’s streams live, but I try and watch the archive when I can. Kiara, your energy and your drive for life are infectious, and I can only strive to take example of that and move forward into the future. Thank you for being you, and for being so real with us, as hard as it can be on the internet.


# FRS

My story begins before EN was announced. I was in the Rabbit Hole months before EN's debut, but I never got the chance to interact with the talents or the fanbase, due to the language barrier or the shyness. This, however, changed when EN was announced. A new brand full of new girls, and a lot of possibilities. It was perfect, I would finally be able to interact more so I decided to check them out And to be honest, I wasn't skeptical of their success but I never expected them to get THIS far. In any case, the debuts happened and I had my impressions of them. Kiara was a very energetic and funny girl, I loved her introduction and how cheery she was, and for that reason I never expected her to become one of my favourites.


I'm not saying it was a bad thing, au contraire, it was a really good thing, but I had a hard time keeping up with such energetic people back then. And I thought that was pretty much what Kiara was going to be, the typical "over the top" girl (which is partially true, even Kiara herself said it one time iirc). Still, I liked her, so I decided to watch her streams Like I said, I thought her energy would be her defining trait but I was wrong. And I realized this the more I watched, she was a sweet person, caring, talented and really grateful to those who gave her a chance. I saw how hard she worked, her struggles to find her own pace and place in the community, even with all the troubles she had to go through in the beginning But what really stole my heart was how honest and genuine she acted, playing a game or talking about herself and the stories she had to share, it all felt natural. It's true that she had a slow start compared to the rest, but that helped to build a solid community, because those who stayed were the ones who really saw Kiara for who she really was. You could even call her a diamond in the rough. Her appreciation for KFP was clear from the beginning to me. Which brings me to the second most important here, the community Like I said at the beginning, I'm a shy person, so even little interactions can make me feel a bit uncomfortable, but after I saw KFP interacting with Kiara, and how she reacted to that, how wholesome it was, I felt like I wanted to be a part of it. So I did: first it was the occasional message in chat, then I started trying to engage more actively when Kiara asked something. This led to more and more interaction with the community and before I realized my insecurities were gone, with KFP at least. This community has helped me a lot, they treated everyone with kindness, welcoming all new fans, and supporting each other.


In my case, Kiara was one of the reasons why I picked up drawing again, but KFP gave me the support I so much needed to keep going, I couldn't be more grateful for that. What I want to say is, I'm happy I gave Kiara a chance all those months ago. I changed, we've changed and Kiara as well, for the better. Back then people saw her and thought of her as the girl who's always crying, the girl with no skills and now they can see a strong, lovable and really talented phoenix. Now I can't help but to feel proud of Kiara. And I can't wait to see what the future holds for her and the great things I'm 100% sure she'll accomplish.


# Leroy._.

I had been a Hololive fan for about half a year and when I saw the announcement of Hololive English I wasn't too excited. I was one of the people who thought that I wouldn't get too interested in them and would just keep watching the JP girls. But oh boy I couldn't have been more wrong. I actually became a fan before the YT debut even started. When I saw one of Kiara's tweets on my timeline about loving chicken sandwiches and later finding out she was made out to be a chicken Vtuber, that's when I fell in love. I thought it was hilarious and loved the meme that was already going on. Besides, I loved Kiara's design the most out of anyone. Then when the debut finally came, it just all clicked. I kept watching and watching, and eventually became a proud employee at KFP!



# Sorakeyblade

My story of how I became a devoted member of the KFP is probably similar to many. Around 2 years ago I was laid off from my teaching job. It was an extremely stressful job, I cried more in that time than I had the last ten years of my life, and the students were rude and difficult to deal with. So I took up substitute teaching, and did that for a couple months. This ended when a student claimed I had slapped another student, and I was no longer allowed to sub for that district despite doing nothing of the sort. I resigned myself to a job that was simple, but didn’t pay very much. The coworkers were extremely nice and the work was simple and fun, so I didn’t mind. But at this point, I was just stuck in a rut, doing the same thing day in and day out. I had long lost contact with any friends from college or high school.

Then, the pandemic hit. It didn’t really change my daily life much, all I did was work, then go home, spending the rest of the day with my cat and a couple of friends through Discord. Now, I was just living at home self-isolating, playing games. And then, some clips started to show up. I saw a girl talk about going to school wearing band-aids as a bra, and it was so weird but hilarious. Eventually, the term Hololive popped up. I was intrigued, but then I found out that they advertised themselves as an Idol company. I was extremely wary, as I’d heard many things about the idol industry, and everything that happened in the shadows. But the pull was too great, and I started watching Korone, and Fubuki. I visited the Hololive subreddit and got to know about the whole JP branch. Aki Rosenthal’s story in Einnashu’s clip touched my heart, I saw Korone’s Banjo-Kazooie stream that was animated by 2Snacks that skyrocketed her popularity, I watched Fubuki’s legendary waiting stream for Marine and Shion. I watched the debut of 5th gen, and I fell further and further down, becoming more and more intrigued. I went back to work, but I was still watching regardless.

And then it happened, the announcement of Hololive English. It floored me that it was happening so soon after the debut of Gen 5, it was so unexpected. I only used Reddit, but I was still exposed to the full hype. The fact that the debuts happened so soon after the announcement led to a large number of people showing up. Like many, I was worried that this whole branch would be similar to how English dubs were treated, and we would get cringe like we’d never seen before. The first debut happened, and I thought my fears were going to be confirmed when I first saw Ms. Calliope Mori. Then, she revealed “Excuse me, could you please RIP?” and all fears that I had vanished in an instant. This was going to be something great. With my expectations well and truly shattered, I moved on to the next debut one Takanashi Kiara.

I would like to say it was love at first sight, but it wasn’t immediate. She sounded cute, despite the scuffed mic. Her relationship with Calliope was interesting, but didn’t grab me. She listed JRPGs as her favorite genre (even saying the Tales of was her favorite), but I wasn’t sure if I could commit to full long streams of those. But I saw the potential, she liked a lot of the stuff I liked, and I was a Day 1 Subscriber. I watched all the other debuts, and I found something to like in each girl. I was well and truly hooked on everyone. For the first month and a half, I did not miss a single stream from anyone. My time zone and work schedule made this a possibility and it was in this month that I slowly discovered my love for Takanashi Kiara.

I laughed at how quickly she started yelling in “Egg is broken, Heart is too” after saying she wasn’t an aggressive player. I was charmed with her singing voice in her first ever karaoke and I cheered for her to keep pushing through Mario 64. I shook my head when she put all the guys in the D tier of Arknights. But the thing that grabbed me the most was her refreshing honesty and her willingness to pour out her heart.

Since I could only speak basic Japanese, it was hard for me to actually “connect” with any of the JP girls, though I knew that they were amazing. The other EN girls I enjoyed for their content and personality, but I always felt a wall. I felt like I KNEW Kiara. From there, she started to change me. I joined a Youtube membership for the first time. I started interacting with a community for the first time, I joined TWO Discord channels with that community. When she said Superchats weren’t necessary, comments, views and likes were enough, I revived my dead Twitter account from 2012, and made sure to like and comment on everything. I picked up streaming for the first time. But most importantly, she gave me something to look forward to every single day. A wonderful girl who’s unwavering passion won me over, and brought me to this great community known as the KFP! Now, I’ve quit my job and look forward to a new uncertain but exciting new future, with Kiara and the KFP at my back.


# Magic


To start my story, I think it was during the last few weeks of the summer break, right before Gen 5 debuted. I found Hololive, which was probably the 2nd best thing to happen to me in 2020. I started watching clips and later I put on whole streams in the background even though I did not understand anything they said. When the break was over I started my first year in university, which was quite a big difference from anything I have done before and the C thing did not make this easier.


As I was busy with studying, trying to adapt to uni and trying to make friends, a certain majestic phoenix and part-time warrior, who would later become someone that means a lot to me, made her debut along with her gen mates. Although I was aware of the debuts, I watched short summaries of all of them instead, as I considered myself too busy to watch the streams in their entirety. Luckily, I got accustomed to uni very quickly and managed to do well (except for the new friends part). Since there was also a (semi-)lockdown, things were quite lonely and I passed my free time watching Hololive JP.


Around mid-October, I remembered being interested in watching Ame and since I just got used to everything and had time again, I took the opportunity to watch something new. The first stream I watched got me very interested, but it was the second stream that sold me…… but not on her. It was the cute, funny, energetic, employee-murdering chi- phoenix that had all my attention. I don’t think I've ever been captivated by a content creator so fast before. Very soon I decided I wanted to get my first ever membership and join Kiara on her journey. I became an egg who shall grow along with her until eventually turning into a … chicken bucket. I don’t think I’ve said this ever before, but if it is for Kiara, then it is worth being fried for. Soon after joining the membership, there were watchalongs of the Lord of the Rings (part 2 and 3). These moments watching my favourite movie series together with Kiara is a memory very special and dear to me, as I had not had that much fun in such a long time.


After that I got deeper and deeper into KFP, I joined the discord and made a Twitter account.

Earlier I mentioned that finding Hololive was the 2nd best thing that happened to me in 2020, the reason why it is not the best is that the best thing happening to me was Kiara joining Hololive and me finding her.


This concludes my origin story of how I joined Kiara and her amazing community on a journey and even though I might be busy sometimes and not that active on twitter/discord, I want you to know that I’m still there, trying to support Kiara to the best of my ability.


# mistfist


A long, long time ago, there was a little mistling who was bored. Recently hired after a long drought of having nothing to do, they found themselves with oddly plentiful amounts of free time, and nothing to spend it on due to anime and gaming fatigue. And suddenly, a reaper appeared in the subscriptions box, attending the Trash Taste podcast.

“Oh,” the mistling said, “Vtubers aren’t weirdos* trying to rake in money from weebs desperate for attention. They’re just streamers having fun.”

So they began to explore the scene, finding the reaper’s friends: the Phoenix, the Shark, the Detective, and the Priestess. The mistling desperately tried to catch up on 2ish months of content, as well as the live streams, and quickly gave up. They had to prioritize.

The mistling chose the Phoenix and the Reaper. Not only because of their personalities clicking with the mistling the most, but because of their interactions with each other, the games they played, and their music. For the Phoenix was releasing her first song, Hinotori, and what better way to show support than becoming a member?

Mistfist was then trapped forever as a chicken, never to see the light of day again.

Finding the KFP discord happened soon after, and with it, comrades to talk with about our Tenchou, all wanted to support her however we could.

And that’s how I, Mistfist, came to become a member of the KFP.

So, it was the 13th of September when I came across a clip of Miko. This was my first contact with a vtuber, only a few hours after Kiara and the other girls had their debuts. Being unable to speak Japanese, I searched “Hololive English.” Results appeared and the first thing I read was the phrase, “HoloEn is HoloMyth.” Now being the top right, highly intellectual mind that I am, I understood this as saying that Hololive English was a myth, as in it did not exist. About a week or so went by, and I came across Inas Call of Cthulhu streams. Having found the experience to be an enjoyable one, I continued to watch her.


After about a week, Ina hosted a collab on her channel, all the En girls playing Gang Beasts. I recall my exact thoughts as the stream came to an end. “Wow, that orange one was really funny.” The next day Kiara streamed her first time ever playing Minecraft, and from that stream on I was hooked. There is a whole list of adjectives that I could use to describe how I saw her. Silly, funny, cute, and so many other positive thoughts, but it can all be summed up in one thought: she made me smile.

        

This was of course in September of 2020, a time when there were not many smiles going around in the world. I should have been in college for another semester, but instead I was alone in my room dealing with online classes and quarantine. Amidst all of this, I was able to really enjoy myself watching her play Minecraft. This was very odd to me, as prior to watching those early Ina streams, I had never paid much attention to streamers, Ina’s only slightly catching my eye. This changed with Kiara’s streams, as I found myself transfixed by her nature. Kiara mentions that she doesn't like to stop talking while she is streaming, and I really believe that is what pulled me in. I wasn't just looking at the screen when Kiara streams were on, I was paying attention to what she was doing. For the first time with a streamer, the streams kept me focused.


In these early months I experienced such a range of emotion. From the heart pouring empathy I felt in her streams with technical difficulties to the happiness around seeing her announce her first song. Building the first KFP, making it through Fire Emblem, struggling with Mario games, seeing her deal with getting terminated and handling it beautifully. Those months are when we saw Kiara really grow and become the Kiara we know now.  


Now, at first I saw people sending superchats and becoming members, and thought to myself, “Why send money to an anime girl on the internet?” Next thing I knew, a few weeks passed and I was a member, and then Christmas Karaoke came around and I sent my first superchat. That day is the day I feel I really joined KFP. I gave myself the job of Field Armorer, figuring somebody had to be around to fix Kiaras sword and shield, and it would be a weird job for a restaurant to have. I got into the discord, changed around my twitter, and took the plunge into full time KFP employment. Immediately I started to recognize names. I would see a name and remember a superchat, or something from chat. Even though this was my first time making myself known, I felt like I already belonged, something that had never happened with me on the internet before.


Ever since then I’ve been doing great. I am up in spirits, my days are brighter, I talk to people like I never have before, and I am so much more motivated to do things. I owe all of this to the people in KFP, and most importantly to Kiara. Her perseverance, her overcoming struggle, her strength and talents all mean so much to me that I have started to see and appreciate those same qualities in places I never would have looked before. So I really owe the biggest thank you to Kiara and everyone at KFP.

How did I find you, Tenchou? Well, Back in 2020 before Hololive EN debuted, I was just a normal guy who loves anime and Japanese culture and also who just discovered Hololive by a certain ELITE clip and got pulled into the rabbit hole, I never watched any streams from Hololive back then, only clips. And luckily, a Hololive clipper advertised the new Hololive EN Vtubers! It was Holomyth! You got my attention from the first look and I was excited for your debut! The day of your debut has finally come, and your debut was my first stream of Hololive I have ever watched! I was impressed by the cute lore story of yours at the start, and then you appeared! You were at the bottom right of the screen peeking until you went “Hai~ Sei… no… KIKKERIKIIIIIIII~!” And just by that my heart went DOKI DOKI and already sold myself to you xD. I was astonished by how you were able to speak 4 languages with the Bird language included and I was amazed to find out that you can sing well with a  beautiful singing voice when you sang SSS at the end. It was my first time hearing that song as well, and that made it even more magical with you singing it. After that, from day one! I decided to follow you and become a fan of you.


How did I join the fanbase and wanted to support you? Well, KFP is my first ever online community I’ve ever joined, at first I was just interacting with people in your stream Pre-Chats, everyone was so welcoming and it was so impressive to see a wholesome community like this especially on the internet, I made a lot of good friends in Pre-Chat, they gave me the idea of becoming The Chair-Kun of KFP and make it as my KFP job and title. Later I joined multiple KFP Discords and made new friends! You created and gave us this family, you changed a lot of people’s lives and made our days better and brighter with your streams! So that’s why I wanted to give something back to you by supporting you in every way I can and for as long as I can, even if it was little, and that’s also why I logged in to my Twitter account back then after 4 years of it being unused just to support you there, and also that opened the doors for me to be able to interact with you and the KFP family even more as well! Thank you Tenchou! And Congratulations on 1 million subs! As long as you're here, then I promise that I’ll try my best to continue supporting & working for you as the Chair-Kun of KFP. o7
